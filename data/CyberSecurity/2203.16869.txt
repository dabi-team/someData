Abstract: The current global pandemic occasioned by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been attributed, partially, to the growing 
range  of  cyber  vises  within  the  cyber  ecosystem.  One  area  of  such  impact  is  the  increasing  tendencies  of  cyber-bullying 
among students. Cyberbullying -the act of subjugating others using a cyber platform- is a growing concern among educators, 
especially in High-Schools. Whilst studies have been carried out towards understanding this menace, the approach towards 
identifying indicators of cyberbullying is largely missing in the literature. To address this research gap, this study proposed a 
cyberbullying framework based on the identification of some observable behavioral indicators. Using a self-administered 
measurement instrument from 30-respondents, the study observed the probability of a cyberbully construct, as a potential 
measure of the presence of cyberbullying; a probability that has been largely ignored in extant literature. This observation 
presents a veritable tool for the development of an active and integrated learning platform void of abuse among students. 
Furthermore,  within  the  cyber  education  ecosystem,  a  cyberbullying  construct  would  provide  a  mechanism  for  the 
development  of  an  appropriate  online  learning  platform,  which  would  be  useful  to  the  information  system  and  cyber 
education research communities.

Introduction

Like physical bullying, cyberbullying can occur in diverse ways, and can also reflect in myriad forms, ranging from 
direct to indirect, intentional to unintentional, one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many as well as overt-to-
covert actions. However, unlike physical bullying, cyberbullying can transcend borders, boundaries, and even 
temporal-spatiality with a long-lasting effect. For instance, any act posted online could be retained for years 
until such an act is repealed or taken down. The concept of cyberbullying, as highlighted in Corliss, (2017) and 
Lee and Chun, (2020), is rooted in diverse ontological definitions which primarily involve the use of technology. 
Put succinctly, cyberbullying is the act of leveraging the power of technology to cause harm or discomfort to 
another.  This  act  is  often  associated  with  frequent  or  repeated  communication  occasioned  by  aggressive 
tendencies (towards a hurtful, disgraceful, harmful, or discomfort outcome) to recipients (Nakano et al., 2016; 
Buelga et al., 2020). Redmond, Lock and Smart, (2020) further dissected technology used to include electronic 
mails,  telecommunication  text  messages,  chat  rooms,  mobile  phones,  web,  and  mobile  cameras,  as  well  as 
websites.  With  the  steady  growth  and  adoption  of  technology,  the  cyberbullying  act  can  be  projected  to 
increase. Different dimensions of cyberbullying acts have been identified in the literature (Langos, 2012). Cyber 
personality has also been defined in existing studies (Adeyemi et al., 2016; Adeyemi, Abd Razak, et al., 2017; 
Adeyemi,  Razak  and  Salleh,  2017;  Adeyemi,  Razak,  et  al.,  2017;  Ikuesan  et  al.,  2019)  with  contradictory 
cyber:physical personalities (Gardini, Cloninger and Venneri, 2009; Mohammadi and Vinciarelli, 2015; Ikuesan, 
Abd Razak and Salleh, 2016). The next section explores the different dimensions of cyberbullying with a view to 
highlighting the underlying commonalities.  

2. Cyberbullying Dimensions

In  trying  to  understand  the  different  dimensions  of  cyberbullying,  it  is  essential  to  fully  understand  what 
cyberbullying  is.  Within  the  research  community,  cyberbullying  has  garnered  diverse  interpretations  and 
consequently,  different  meanings  (Langos,  2012;  Redmond,  Lock  and  Smart,  2020).  Building  on  traditional 
bullying,  as  measured  by  the  Olwens  Bullying  questionnaire,  studies  have  revealed  that  respondents  often 
equate cyberbullying to acts that involve the internet and technology (Dennehy et al., 2020; Fernández-Antelo, 
Cuadrado-Gordillo  and  Parrà,  2020).  For  example,  the  item  “somebody  used  the  internet  or  a  cellphone  to 
harm/offend me” has been regarded as an act of cyberbullying. As elaborated in existing studies (Corliss, 2017; 
Redmond,  Lock  and  Smart,  2020),  these  definitions  and  perspectives,  as  a  construct,  present  a  complex 
phenomenon that requires more insight. Position in Langos, (2012) summarized the existing definitions within 
the context of intention: direct or indirect. The study coined the definition as “Cyberbullying involves the use of 
ICTs  to  carry  out  a  series  of  acts  as  in  the  case  of  direct  cyberbullying,  or  an  act  as  in  the  case  of  indirect 

Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Information Warfare and Security, 2022 1Salam Khalifa Al-Romaihi and Richard Adeyemi Ikuesan 

cyberbullying, intended to harm another (the victim) who cannot easily defend him or herself”. The definition 
reveals  cyberbullying  to  include  acts  of  willfulness,  power  imbalance,  repetitiveness,  perception-based 
cognition,  as  well  as  a  technology-integrated  process.  Moreover,  the  integration  of  “cyber”  into  traditional 
bullying presents a susceptibility and vulnerability beyond temporal-spatial boundaries, which further enhanced 
the proclivity for bullying. Therefore, irrespective of the perspective of the definition from diverse stakeholders, 
the  underlying  tenet  of  cyberbullying  remains  visible  for  evaluation.  Evaluating  cyberbullying,  its  effect,  and 
potential mitigation approaches can be hinged the process of identifying cyberbullying cues, hereinafter refers 
to  indicators.  A  study  in  (Redmond,  Lock  and  Smart,  2020)  presented  three  perspectives  of  cyberbullying 
indicators based on bully attributes, using a taxonomical structure. The study leveraged bully attributes, bullying 
categories,  awareness  based on  the victim’s  and  educator’s  perspective.  These  attributes,  further  classed  as 
Category-1, provide a baseline for cyberbullying identification within the cyberbullying conceptual framework. 
Whilst the identification of cyberbullying act, specifically from the student’s perspective, presents a means for 
cyberbullying construct development (Dennehy  et al., 2020; Fernández-Antelo, Cuadrado-Gordillo and Parrà, 
2020),  the  content  presented  in  the  conceptual  framework  lacks  useful  composition  that  can  be  used  as 
indicators  or  precursors.  Cyber  bully  indicator  can  be  defined  within  a  context  or  in  perspective:  the  victim, 
perpetrator, or collaborators, for example. These perspectives are further distilled using the modified Olwens’ 
bullying cycle shown in Figure 1. Two potentially applicable perspectives (E2 and E3) are integrated into the 
cycle: unwilling supporter and unconscious supporter. These perspectives has been clustered together in some 
studies to mean unintentional bullies (Langos, 2012). However, recent advances in technology have provided a 
baseline for the separating these two perspectives.

Figure 1: Modified Olwen’s bullying cycle. 

An unwilling supporter is an entity who does not like bullying but thinks he/she has no option other than to 
partake.  This  entity  can  also  be  termed  a  victim  of  the  bullying  act.  The  second  category;  an  unconscious 
supporter, is an entity whose action/inaction unknowing encourages bullying. This category could potentially 
form  a  large  population.  This  is  particularly  applicable  to  a  cyber-induced  bullying  process  where  entities 
unknowingly  provide  support  to  abusive  acts  that  could  harm  others.  Therefore,  approaches  that  provide 
measures  for  reliably  identifying  signs  and  markers  of  cyberbullying  are  largely  missing  in  the  literature. 
Indicators  in  this  regard  refer  to  a  measurable  instrument  that  can  be  used  to  deduce  the  tendency  and  or 
presence of cyberbullying act/process. To address this observed limitation, this study explores the probability of 
extracting inherent markers of cyberbullying. The study further proposed an identification mechanism rooted in 
the result of the exploratory process. To the best of the Authors’ knowledge, this study serves as a pioneering 
insight towards the development of a reliable construct, hereinafter referred to as the Cyber Bullying Indicator 
construct (CBIC). Within the general body of information systems, a construct is a concept of abstraction that 
cannot be directly described using a singular entity, however, exist, nonetheless. Constructs such as Perceived 

Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Information Warfare and Security, 2022 2Salam Khalifa Al-Romaihi and Richard Adeyemi Ikuesan 

Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), and Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) are examples of constructs 
that have been widely used in the literature. This study, therefore, presents a foundational basis on which a CBIC 
can be developed.  This is achieved based on an underlying research question given thus: Given the growing 
tendency of online cyberbullying in educational settings, can the use of a quantitative exploratory study be used 
to identify any underlying constructs that can explain cyberbullying with a Cronbach’s alpha reliability greater 
than 0.7?  

The remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows: the next section discusses the methodology applied in 
this  study  to  explore  the  conceptualization  of  the  construct.  This  is  followed  by  the  presentation  of  the 
exploratory result and an in-depth analysis of the result. Conclusion and future works are thereafter provided.  

3. Methodology

Given  the  nature  of  cyberbullying,  and  the  scope  of  this  study,  an  exploratory  quantitative  approach  was 
considered.  A  set  of  measurement  instruments  was  developed  based  on  the  exploration  of  common 
cyberbullying  concepts  used  in  literature.  The  final  compilation  comprised  20-items.  Each  item  represents  a 
potential measure of bullying indicator. This includes the two ends of the bullying cycle spectrum identified in 
Figure 1: the bully (A) and the victim (Y).  To select participants for this study, three criteria were defined as 
shown in Table 1. Taken together, the criteria provide a guide for respondent selection.  

Table 1: Respondent Inclusion Criteria 

Criteria  Description

Upon receipt of ethical clearance from the institution, the preliminary exploratory process was conducted. The 
questionnaire instrument was sent to selected Faculties in the institution via email. This process leveraged the 
purposive non-probability sampling technique as opposed to the probabilistic random sampling technique. The 
summary of the measurement instrument developed for this study is further shown in Table 2. The instrument 
contains 20 items adapted from existing studies, which can be further grouped into two classes.

A total of 30 responses were received. Whilst the sample size of 30-response is relatively small, the  authors 
assert that the sample presents a baseline for further studies. As highlighted in Lee and Chun (2020), studies on 
conceptualizing cyberbullying can leverage a sample size greater than 10-response. The sample in the current 
study  is  relatively  higher  than  the  sample  used  in  Phase-2  of  the  concept  mapping  process  in  Lee  and  Chun 
(2020).  Given  that  this  is  the  preliminary  insight  into  the  subject  matter,  the  sample  size  was  considered 
sufficient for this study. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) v23 was used to conduct the exploratory 
process while SMART PLS (student License) was used to explore confirmatory factor analysis. The detail of the 
result is presented in the next section.

4. Result and Analysis

An exploratory analysis typically involves the process of extracting the underlying intrinsic cluster in data. To do 
this, the Cronbach’s Alpha test of instrument reliability was carried out. The result showed that the items were 
indeed reliable with a Cronbach’s Alpha value of 0.803. The Kaiser, Meyer, Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling 
adequacy generated poor sphericity at 0.346 which was an expected outcome, given the overall sample size 
used in this study. In the initial factor exploration, no pre-defined number of clusters was considered (which 
implied  an  Eigenvalue 
  was  considered).  A  total  of  5-underlying  factors  was  extracted  using  maximum 
likelihood  as  the  method  of  extraction.  A  further  observation  of  the  result  showed  that  the  data  has  two

underlying  factors.  Thus,  pruning  the  factor  into  two  and  suppressing  coefficients

revealed two overlapping factors, at a

. From the extracted pattern, 4-items had relatively similar

cross-loading. These items were deleted. Furthermore, 7-items and 9-items were classified as factors 1 and 2 
respectively. To perform the confirmatory analysis, the pruned data was used to model the path analysis. The 
path model revealed the factor loading of three items to be less than 0.4. These items were further removed. 
The resultant path model is presented in Table 3 and Figure 2. The observed path coefficient between the two 
factors was 0.55.

From the result shown in Table 3, it certainly appears that the two factors can model the measurement items. 
The factor loading for all items in Factor-1 (hereinafter referred to as Phase-1) and Factor-2 (hereinafter referred 
to  as  Phase-2)  are  greater  than  0.4.  In  terms  of  construct  reliability  and  validity,  both  factors  satisfied  the 
standard thumb rule for the Cronbach’s alpha, rho alpha, and composite reliability. However, the AVE was below 
the 0.5 thumb rule. Using Phase-1 as a predictor variable for Phase-2 and vice versa, the study generated an 
identical regression weight (0.555) which further shows the probable existence of two variables that can be used 
to measure the proposed cyberbullying construct.  

5. Discussion

The result presented in the previous section revealed the probability of the existence of a cyberbullying indicator 
construct. A cyberbullying construct provides a baseline for measuring the presence of bullying, which can be 
measured by parents, guardians, as well as educators. Often, subtle bullying process among secondary school 
students can go undetected until it causes damages to the victims. This study, therefore, serves as a first step 
towards  mitigating  cyberbullying  act,  especially  among  secondary  school  students.  With  such  an  indicator, 
different stakeholders can identify signs before it degenerates into psychological and physical trauma. This is 
especially  useful  given  the  trendy  adoption  of  digital  lifestyle  occasioned  by  the  Covid-19  pandemic  and  the 
potential for an inseparable work-life balance for parents. Cyberbullying is relatively difficult to identify without 

Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Information Warfare and Security, 2022 4Salam Khalifa Al-Romaihi and Richard Adeyemi Ikuesan 

the core indicators, relative to physical bullying (Lee and Chun, 2020). Indicators in this regard reveal necessary 
precursors that can be used to glean the emergence or inception of a cyber induced bullying process. A summary 
of the final measurement is given in Table 2. A breakdown of the item’s clusters in Table 2 shows that there exist 
some underlying tendencies that can be further classified into Phase-1 and Phase-2 behavior. Both Phases 1 and 
2 depict a reflective indicator that shows the behavior of an entity after an incident has occurred. For example, 
the concept of abrupt change in behavior after an online experience could reflect what had transpired during an 
Internet surfing period. This behavior could result in excitement on the part of the bully, while the converse 
would  be  seen  on  the  victim.  The  items  defined  within  this  study  can  be  further  examined  in  line  with  the 
underlying  tenet  in  each  item.  Though  words  like  withdrawer,  abrupt,  highly  irritable,  emotional,  as  well  as 
upset, are general terms associated with victims of a bully, the concept of cyber content is revealed in words 
like an electronic message, internet gaming, online activities, techno-isolation, computing device, and online-
gadget.  These  keywords  can  be  associated  with  cyber  activities.  Though  the  current  exploratory  analysis 
generated  two  clusters,  a  confirmation  of  this  would  be  rigorously  carried  in  the  subsequent  study.  This  is 
essentially required to formulate a steady construct for the CBIC. A theoretical analysis of the measurement 
items in each Phase did not reveal a remarkable distinction. This further explains the need for further study.   

Ideally, a construct consists of a singular class, and the process to formally develop such would pass through a 
series of reliability tests. Further study with a significantly larger sample size will be carried out to ascertain the 
feasibility  of  developing  the  CBIC.  As  an  ongoing  work,  a  further  study  that  involves  the  development  of  a 
nomological network, as well as external factors that can be used to validate the probability of the existence of 
the CBIC, will be carried out. This attempt will leverage constructs from other information systems models such 
as the theory of planned behavior and the extended technology acceptance model. Also, other cyberbullying 
constructs such as the CYB-AGS (Buelga et al., 2020) aggressive scale can be explored. Such a network can be 
used to measure the impact of cyber education and awareness against potential bullies. One aspect that is not 
considered in this study is the influence of the internet as a tool that aids anonymity. This notion can have a 
potential impact on  who becomes a bully, and the transformative tendencies of cyberbullying. For instance, 
some  studies  (Haddadain,  Abedin  and  Monirpoor,  2010;  Yue  et  al.,  2010;  Sari,  2016)  have  shown  that  the 
anonymity provided by the Internet induces different kinds of personalities on the Internet. This could further 
influence the degree of power imbalance associated with bullying. Opinion in Dennehy et al., (2020) argued that 
the bully’s “inability to witness the victim's reaction may diminish their empathetic response potentially leading 
to more harshness in the cyber behaviors”. In addition, online anonymity could induce unintentional bullying, 
which existing studies have not explored. Online anonymity can be perceived differently between the bully and 
the victim. Further study on the reaction of Victims to cyberbullying is an aspect that can provide concrete insight 
into  this  perspective.  Conjecturing  or  attempting  to  hypothesize  on  the  possible  behaviorism  of  the  victim 
without empirical proof, could be misleading.  

6.  Conclusion 

The concept of cyberbullying has been transformed with the advances in technology. This study explored the 
potential of developing a construct that can be used by different stakeholders to pinpoint and or identify the 
inception  of  cyberbullying  act.  Using  an  exploratory  process,  the  study  observed  with  high  reliability,  the 
probability of the existence of such a construct, which is further defined as cyberbullying indication construct 
(CBIC). However, the sample size used in this current study presents a major limitation of the study. A CIBC, 
when fully explored on larger sample size, can be a veritable tool for mitigating cyberbullying among vulnerable 
entities. Such a tool can be leveraged by the wider scientific community in advancing cyberbullying research. 
Furthermore, the integration of the proposed construct with other information systems constructs can be used 
to develop a nomological network for studying the effect  of cyberbullying on students, as well as workplace 
culture.
