ABSTRACT 

Though,  Ipv6  has  presented  a  long  list  of  features  that  will  actually  change  the  entire 
networking environment, it still represents a very small proportion of Internet traffic. One of 
the  major  reasons  behind  its  partial  acceptance  is  its  security,  as  these  features  were 
incorporated in Ipv6 just to enhance its overall performance and quality of service, thereby 
neglecting  its  security  part.  One  such  feature  is  Stateless  Address  Auto  Configuration  or 
simply SLAAC, which have undoubtedly reduced a lot of overhead in configuring networks, 
but  on  the  same  time  it  has  challenged  the  security  of  Ipv6  networks.  This  research  work, 
therefore  targets  at  proposing  some  security  policies  to  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with 
SLAAC, by understanding its working scenario and trying to create the possible attack vector 
to  highlight  its  security  concerns.  Hence,  the  implementation  of  these  policies  will  directly 
add security to networks and make them resistant to SLAAC based attacks.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Using  IPv6  [1],  [2],  a  host  machine  can 
generate  its  own  IP  address,  without  any 
need  for  configuration  or  need  of  any 
additional  address  configuring  servers.  This 
automated  process  of  address  generation  is 
termed 
Stateless  Address  Auto 
Configuration  or  simply  SLAAC  [1],  [2], 
[3]. 

as 

SLAAC  allows  host  devices  within  IPv6 
networks to configure its own IP address by 
combining locally available information and 
parameters  found  in  Router  Advertisements 
or  simply  RA’s  [4].  IPv6  enabled  routers

advertise 

information 

identify 

that 

network  associated  with  it,  while  hosts 
generates  a  unique  interface  identifier.  A 
combination of both forms an IPv6 address. 
SLAAC  therefore  has  provided  a  massive 
accountability  to  routers,  which  in  point  of 
to  SLAAC-based 
fact  has  given  birth 
attacks.  

Such  attacks  can  involve  an  attacker  to  kill 
the  default  router  to  introduce  a  DOS  [5] 
factor, or make a fake router to become the 
default  router  of  the  network  to  fetch  the 
entire  network  traffic  and  introduce  MITM 
factor.  Further,  more  complicated 
[6] 
SLAAC  based  attacks  can 
involve  an 
attacker  to  forward  the  fetched  traffic  to  a 
fake DNS [7]. So once the host devices  get

malicious intentions.  

SLAAC  and  its  security  implications.  This 
research,  in  particularly,  focus  at  security 
concerns of SLAAC and propose policies to 
develop a mitigation system against them. 

In this paper, I therefore present the possible 
attack vectors to figure out vulnerabilities in 
SLAAC.  By  its  end,  my  research  work 
concludes  by  stressing  on  some  security 
policies,  which  when  implemented  will 
make  networks  much  more  secure  and 
resistant to such SLAAC based attacks. 

The  rest  of  this  research  work  is  organized 
into  following  sections:  Section-2  gives  an 
overview  of  the  related  work;  Section-3 
focuses on the working of SLAAC; Section-
4  highlights 
the  security  concerns  of 
SLAAC  and  possible  attacks;  Section-5 
presents  the  proposed  security  policies  and 
concludes the research work. 

II.  RELATED WORK: 

The  related  work  to  Ipv6-SLAAC  can  be 
categorized  into  following  3  categories:  a) 
Basics  of  IPv6  and  its  features;  b)  IPv6 
vulnerabilities  and  its  security;  c)  IPv6

Ipv6 is popular for its numerous benefits to 
end users. Gone are the days of Ipv4, when 
end  users  needed 
their 
machines  manually  or  at  least  configure 
their  DHCP  [8]  server  to  reduce  a  bit  of 
overhead.  Ipv6  has  introduced  the  concept 
of 'hot plugging', which will allow a host to 
configure  its  Ipv6  address  automatically 
once  it  is  connected  to  a  hotspot  within  a 
network.

IV.  THE ATTACK VECTORS: 

Though  SLAAC  has  automated  a  part  of 
network  administration,  a  gap 
its 
adaptation  has  left  the  end  users  prone  to 
attacks.  Thus,  this  section,  in  particularly 
examines  this  gap  to  create  possible  attack 
vectors  and  figure  out  the  vulnerabilities  in 
SLAAC.  

in 

There  is  a  possibility  that  an  attacker  can 
intercept  the  communication  link  between 
the  host  machines  and  the  default  router, 
and  then  misuse  the  total  automation  factor 
in  SLAAC.  This  malicious  intention  is 
terms  of 
given  a 
following steps: 

real-time  effect 

in 

STEP-1:  

The  attacker,  at  first  tries  to  intercept  the 
actual  link  between  the  default  router  and 
the  host  machines  by  altering  the  Router 
Advertisements  of  the  default  router.  The 
goal behind altering these RA's is to change 
the  router  lifetime  which  defines  the  time 
limit  of  concerned  router  to  act  as  default 
router  for  that  network.  But  before  an 
attacker  can  alter  these  RA's,  he  needs  to 
capture these RA's by  becoming the part of 
the network.

STEP-2: 

STEP-3:  

Now  once  the  attacker  is  successful  in 
capturing  valid  RA's  from  a  default  router, 
by  changing  the  router  lifetime  available 
these RA's to a value of zero, an attacker is 
easily  able  to  make  the  host  devices  to 
remove  the  default  router  from  its  routing 
table as shown in Figure-2. 

After an attacker has spoofed the valid RA's 
and  removed  the  default  router  from  the 
routing  table,  it  is  the  right  time  for  him  to 
make  his  final  move.  Now  at  this  stage  an 
attacker  can  proceed  with  one  of 
the 
following as per his target and intentions:

•  SLAAC-  BASED  DENIAL  OF 

SERVICE VECTOR:  

Once  the  attacker  is  successful  to  remove 
the default router from the network, the host 
machines  will  have  no  default  route  to 
transfer  their  packets.  It  itself  is  enough  to 
mount  a  DOS  attack.  Further,  an  attacker 
can also advertise the address of a non-local 
router  or  a  machine  without 
routing 
capabilities  using  fake  RA's,  which  will  be 
installed  as  the  default  gateway  for  host 
machines  once  they  get  configured  using 
SLAAC,  as  shown  in  Figure-3.  Since  these 
devices will not be able to route the packets 
to  their  desired  destinations,  as  they  do  not 
exist 
locally  or  do  not  have  routing 
capability,  every  request  by  the  host  device 
will  end  up  at  'Denial  of  Services'  response 
by the service provider.

router.  Since  the  network  uses  SLAAC  for

to  get 

address  configuration,  the  total  automation 
factor involved in this process will not allow 
the end user to know about the transition in 
the  host  devices  get 
the  route.  Once 
configured  using  fake  RA's,  the  attacker, 
being 'man in the middle' is able to fetch the 
entire  traffic  to  his  router  and  can  hamper 
the privacy of data. 

•  SLAAC-  BASED  DUAL-STACK 

FAKE ROUTING VECTOR:  

This  attack  actually  targets  a  fully  working 
Ipv4  network  with  IPv4  based  router  to 
route  the  packets  between  the  hosts  and 
Internet,  as  shown  in  Figure-4.  Since  most 
of  the  operating  systems  nowadays  have 
Ipv6  enabled  by  default,  they  are  prone  to 
get  configured  by  an  IPv6  enabled  fake 
router using SLAAC.  

Hence,  this  attack  vector  can  target  IPv4 
networks  with  IPv6-  enabled  host  devices, 
and  will  involve  an  attacker  to  deploy  a 
Dual-Stack [13] router with Ipv6 addressing 
interface on the host side to fetch the entire 
traffic.

Since,  by  default,  Ipv6  addressing  has  a 
higher  priority  over  Ipv4  addressing,  the 
dual  stack  router  deployed  by  the  attacker 
will  configure  the  host  machines  using 
SLAAC  and  will  become  the  default  router 
for the network, as shown in Figure-5. Now 
when  an  attacker  is  successful  in  fetching 
the network traffic to the router deployed by 
him,  he  can  easily  route  this  traffic  to  any 
spoofed  or  fake  DNS  again  controlled  by 
him  using  the  concept  of  NAT-PT  [14]  on 
the fake router.

The  above  cases  directly 
the 
attacking  strategies  that  can  be  used  to 
exploit the vulnerabilities in SLAAC. These 
attack  vectors  can  prove  to  be  highly  risky 
for  both  IPv4  as  well  as  Ipv6  based 
networks,  as  SLAAC  itself  do  not  provide 

any monitoring or mitigating system against 
such attacks  

V.  SECURITY CONCERNS OF 

SLAAC:

As  noted  in  the  previous  sections,  SLAAC 
largely depends on routers in the process of 
address auto configuration. Since routers are

assignments  under 
Ipv6  SLAAC,  and 
perform IP based authentication by itself, an 
attacker can  easily  spoof a trusted router or 
even  place  a  fake  router  to  fetch  the  entire 
network traffic and employ any of the attack 
vectors  discussed  before.  The  following 
point’s  highlights  the  concerns  associated 
with  this  huge  accountability  provided  to

routers  in  SLAAC  and  how  these  concerns 
can  be  used  by  an  attacker  to  target  the 
security of networks.

information  as  a  part  of  RA's.  These 
RA's are directly received and processed 
by host machines without any checks to 
get  an  IPv6  addresses.    But  fake  or 
bogus  routing  information  sent  through 
RA's  can  substantiate  an  attacker  to 
request  a  connection  to  host  machines 
and capture their traffic.

will  have  to  reply  for  every  received

easily lead to a network crash.

identifiers 
remains  unchanged  regardless  of  the 
network they are associated with. It is so 
because  SLAAC,  by  default,  uses  the 
MAC  address  as  the  interface  identifier 
[15].  This  directly  exposes  the  host 
machines  to  the  attacker  if  he  can  fetch 
the  entire  traffic  of  the  network  to  a 
router  under  his  control.  This  might 
likewise  imply  that  the  host  machines 
are  vulnerable  against  device  tracking 
and  additionally  simple

attacks from anyplace as far and wide as 
possible. Hence SLAAC, in other words

the 
network. 

targets 

The  above  concerns  clearly  highlight  the 
fact  that  the  use  of  SLAAC  can  possibly 
lead to service delays, connection drops and 
eavesdropping.  

VI.  SECURITY POLICIES: 

As clear from above section, SLAAC can be 
a  huge  risk  once  the  host  machines  get 
configured  by  a  malicious  router  and  this 
can  directly  target  privacy  and  security  of 
data  on  the  network.  Hence  it  is  very 
important  to  cover  the  gap  in  adaptation  of 
SLAAC to ensure security of networks. The 
following  security  policies  can  play  a  vital 
role in diminishing the risks associated with 
thereby  making 
SLAAC  based  attacks, 
SLAAC  a  much  more  powerful  and  secure 
feature  of  IP  Next  Generation  Protocol. 
Such policies will help to identify malicious 
Router Advertisements [16], as well as will 
rapidly  recover  from  a  state  where  host 
machines  have  already  configured  using 
such a fake RA.

replacing  the  default  router  in  the  network 
will  become  almost  impossible,  and  hence 
the  network  can  easily  be  secured  from 
SLAAC based attacks. Usually the first hop 
for  host  devices  on  a  network  is  a  switch; 
therefore  by  implementing  the  right  set  of 
security  features  on  layer-2  itself,  we  can 
block  fake  RA's.  Many  good  tools  are 
available  that  work  on  Layer  2  managed 
switches.  RA  Guard  [17]  is  one  such  tool

that  monitors  Router  Advertisements  and 
block  unknown  or  fake  RA's.  Another  way 
to  block  fake  RA's  is  to  introduce  the 
concept  of  Access  Control  Lists  once 
default  routers  of  the  network  are  defined. 
Using ACL's, only known RA's are allowed 
to  user  ports  and  others  can  be  dropped  if 
they  are  known  to  be  originated  from  fake 
or unknown routers.  

•  USE OF SLAAC IN 

SYNCHRONIZATION WITH SE-ND:  

Under  Ipv6,  host  machines  uses  Neighbor 
Discovery  Protocol  [18]  (NDP)  for  various 
purposes  such  as  to  discover  neighboring 
host machines and routers. Secure Neighbor 
Discovery  or  simply  Se-ND  [18]  is  the 
advanced  version  of  NDP  that  has  patched 
the  existing  security  related  flaws  in  it.  Se-
ND is a powerful protocol that uses various 
features to ensure that security of a network 
is not compromised in anyway. Certification 
Paths  and  Cryptographically  Generated 
Addresses  are two main  features of Se-ND, 
that ensure authenticity of devices, both the 
hosts as well as the routers, on the network. 
So a network architecture that uses SLAAC 
synchronized  with  Se-ND  protocol  can 
possibly  ensure  that  host  machines  get 
configured 
for  addresses  using  known 
native routers. Further this practice can even 
restrict  untrusted  host  devices  to  connect  to 
the network and cause malicious functions 

•  LEGITIMATE  ROUTERS  SHOULD 
TAGGED  WITH  HIGH 

BE 
PREFERENCE:  

Router  preference  allows  routers  to  be 
classified  into  three  levels:    Low,  Medium 
and  High.  If  known  and  trusted  routers  can 
be  tagged  with  high  preference,  this  could

example,  Windows  Internet  Connection

to 

given  high-level  of  preference,  it  will  be 
their RA's that will be utilized to proceed for 
SLAAC. So Router Preference policy might 
be  utilized  to  recognize  legitimate  routers 
and  hence  can  act  as  a  mitigation  system 
against the fake routers. 

•  IMPLEMENT ‘2-HOUR RULE’ [19] 

TO RECOVER AFTER 
PROCESSING A FAKE RA:  

Once  a  host  device  processes  a  fake  RA,  it 
may  reach  to  a  conflicting  state  because  of 
configuring  multiple  gateways  or  global 
addresses.  This  is  the  right  time  when  the 
network  administrators  should  get  active 
and  implement  ‘2-hour  Rule’  proposed  in 
RFC  4862-  Section  5.3.3.  This  policy  will 
help to recover from this critical stage.

users, 
somewhere  lack  the  trust  to  use  IPv6.  The 
major  reason  behind  this  hesitation  is  the 
security  of  IPv6,  which  is  not  yet  matured 
enough  to  shield  networks  from  attacks.  
Hence  there  is  a  need  to  scrutinize  the 
individual  features  of  IPv6,  in  order  to 
understand  the  risks  associated  with  them 
and develop mitigating systems accordingly. 
This  research  work  was  targeted  to  explore 
SLAAC  in  order  to  find  out  the  existing 
vulnerabilities  in  it  and  frame  out  certain 
security policies that can actually secure the 
networks  that  use  the  concept  of  address 
auto-configuration.  The  proposed  security 
policies  will  diminish  the  risks  associated 
with  the  Denial  of  Service,  Man  in  the 
Middle  and  Dual-Stack  Rouge  Routing 
variants  of  SLAAC-  based  attacks  and 
hence  directly  enhance  the  security  of 
networks.
