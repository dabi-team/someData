1. Introduction

Cyberspace has come to be an integral part of our society. Government agencies, schools, hospitals, corporations,

ﬁnancial institutions and other organizations ceaselessly collect, process, and store a great deal of data on computers

and transmit these conﬁdential data across networks to other computers [1, 2]. However, cyberspace is vulnerable

to a wide range of cyber threats. Sophisticated cyber perpetrators exploit vulnerabilities to steal information and

money and develop capabilities to disrupt and destroy essential cyber services.

In light of the risk and potential

consequences of cyber attacks, strengthening the security and resilience of cyberspace has become an important

mission. Cybersecurity is committed to protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unintended or

unauthorized access, change, or destruction [3–5]. You cannot manage if you cannot measure. Before working out

cyberspace security solutions, the security of cyber networks must be evaluated [6–8].

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a newly emerging class of cyber attacks. With a clear goal, an APT

attack is highly targeted, well-organized, well-resourced, covert and long-term [9–11]. APTs pose a severe threat to

cyberspace, because they invalidate conventional cyber defense mechanisms. In the last decade, the number of APTs

increased rapidly and numerous security incidents were reported all over the world [12]. For the purpose of resisting

APTs, it is vital to evaluate the security of cyber networks under APTs. However, due to the persistence of APTs,

existing security evaluation methods are not applicable to APTs [13–17]. Recently, Pendleton et al. [18] considered

the expected fraction of compromised nodes in a cyber network as a security metric of the network. As the fraction is

varying over time, its availability is questionable.

To measure the security of a cyber network under APTs, an APT-based cyber attack-defense process must be

modeled as a continuous-time dynamical system. The individual-level dynamical modeling technique, which has

been applied to areas such as epidemic spreading [19–21], malware spreading [22–29], rumor spreading [30, 31] and

viral marketing [32], is especially suited to the modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes, because the

topological structure of the targeted cyber network can be accommodated [33]. Towards this direction, a number of

APT-based cyber attack-defense models have been proposed [34–36]. In particular, Zheng et al. [37] found that a

special APT-based cyber attack-defense model exhibits a global stability.

This paper focuses on estimating security of cyber networks under APTs. First, an APT-based cyber attack-

defense process is modeled as an individual-level dynamical system. Second, the dynamic model is shown to exhibit

the global stability. On this basis, a new security metric of cyber networks, which is known as the limit security, is

deﬁned as the limit expected fraction of compromised nodes in the networks. Next, the inﬂuence of diﬀerent factors

on the limit security is illuminated through theoretical analysis and computer simulation. This work helps understand

the security of cyber networks under APTs.

The remaining materials are organized this way. Section 2 derives an APT-based cyber attack-defense model.

Section 3 shows the global stability of the model and deﬁnes the limit security of cyber networks. The inﬂuence of

diﬀerent factors on the limit security is made clear in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, Section 6 closes this work.

2. The modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes

For the purpose of evaluating the security of a cyber network under APTs, understanding the relevant cyber attack-

defense process is requisite. This is the goal of this section.

2.1. The cyber network

Let G = (V, E) denote the network interconnecting computers in a given cyber network, where V = {1, · · · , N},

each node represents a computer in the cyber network, and there is an edge from node i to node j if and only if

2

computer i is allowed to deliver messages directly to computer j through the network. Let A = (cid:16)

(cid:17)

ai j

N×N

denote the

adjacency matrix for G. Hereafter, G is assumed to be strongly connected.

In what follows, it is assumed that, at any time, every node in the cyber network is either secure or compromised,

where all secure nodes are under the defender’s control, and all compromised nodes are under the attacker’s control.

Let Xi(t) = 0 and 1 denote that node i is secure and compromised at time t, respectively. Then the state of the cyber

network at time t is represented by the vector

X(t) = (X1(t), X2(t), · · · , XN(t)).

Let S i(t) and Ci(t) denote the probability of node i being secure and compromised at time t, respectively.

S i(t) = Pr{Xi(t) = 0}, Ci(t) = Pr{Xi(t) = 1}.

As S i(t) + Ci(t) ≡ 1, the vector C(t) = (C1(t), · · · , CN(t))T represents the expected state of the cyber network at time t.

2.2. The attack and defense mechanisms

The threat of an APT attack to the cyber network is twofold.

• External attack, which is conducted by the external attacker, with the intent of compromising the secure nodes

in the network. The attack strength to secure node i is αxi, where α stands for the technical level of external
attack, xi stands for the resource per unit time used for attacking node i, (cid:80)N

i=1 xi > 0.

• Internal infection, which is caused by the compromised nodes in the network, with the intent of compromising

the secure nodes in the network. The infection strength of compromised node i to secure node j is βai j, where

β stands for the technical level of internal infection. The combined infection strength to secure node i at time t

(cid:16)

is f

β (cid:80)N

j=1 a ji1{x j(t)=1}

(cid:17)

, where 1A stands for the indicator function of event A, f (0) = 0, f (x) ≤ x for all x ≥ 0,

f is strictly increasing and concave, and f is second continuously diﬀerentiable.

We refer to the vector x = (x1, · · · , xN) as an attack scheme. The resource per unit time for the attack scheme x is

||x||1 = (cid:80)N

i=1 xi, where || · ||1 stands for the 1-norm of vectors. .

The defense of the cyber network against APTs is also twofold.

• Prevention, which aims to prevent the secure nodes in the cyber network from being compromised. The pre-

vention strength of secure node i is δyi, where δ stands for the technical level of prevention, yi > 0 stands for

the resource per unit time used for preventing node i.

• Recovery, which is intended to recover the compromised nodes in the cyber network. The recovery strength of

compromised i is γzi, where γ stands for the technical level of recovery, zi > 0 stands for the resource per unit

time for recovering node i.

3

We refer to the vector y = (y1, · · · , yN) as a prevention scheme, the vector z = (z1, · · · , zN) as a recovery scheme,

and the vector (y, z) as a defense scheme. The resources per unit time for the prevention scheme y, the recovery

scheme y and the defense scheme (y, z) are ||y||1, ||z||1 and ||y||1 + ||z||1, respectively.

Let w = (w1, · · · , wN) denote an attack scheme or a prevention scheme or a recovery scheme. In the subsequent

study, the following two schemes will be used.

• The degree-ﬁrst scheme: wi is linearly proportional to the out-degree of node i. Formally,

2.3. The modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes

For the purpose of modeling APT-based cyber attack-defense processes, the following assumptions are made.

(A1) Due to external attack, at any time secure node i gets compromised at rate αxi
δyi

. This assumption is rational,

because the rate is proportional to the attack strength and is inversely proportional to the prevention strength.

(A2) Due to internal infection, at any time secure node i gets compromised at rate

(cid:16)

f

β (cid:80)N

j=1 a ji1{x j (t)=1}

(cid:17)

δyi

. This assumption

is rational, because the rate is proportional to the combined infection strength and is inversely proportional to

the prevention strength.

(A3) Due to recovery, at any time compromised node i becomes secure at rate γzi. This assumption is rational,

because the rate is proportional to the recovery strength.

Next, let us model the cyber attack-defense process. Let ∆t be a very small time interval. Following the above

assumptions, we have that, for i = 1, · · · , N, t ≥ 0,

Pr{Xi(t + ∆t) = 1 | Xi(t) = 0} =

Invoking the total probability formula, rearranging the terms, dividing both sides by ∆t, and letting ∆t → 0, we get a

dynamic model as follows.

We refer to the model as the generic secure-compromised-secure (GSCS) model, because the function f meets a set of

generic conditions. The diagram of state transitions of node i under this model is given in Fig. 1. To a certain extent,

the GSCS model accurately captures APT-based cyber attack-defense processes.

It is trivial to show that C(t) ∈ Ω for t ≥ 0.

3. Theoretical analysis of the GSCS model

This section is dedicated to studying the dynamical properties of the GSCS model.

3.1. Preliminaries

For fundamental knowledge on diﬀerential dynamical systems, see Ref. [38].

Lemma 1. (Chaplygin Lemma, see Theorem 31.4 in [39]) Consider a smooth n-dimensional system of diﬀerential

equations

and the corresponding system of diﬀerential inequalities

dx(t)
dt

= f((x(t)),

t ≥ 0

with x(0) = y(0). Suppose that for any a1, · · · , an ≥ 0, there hold

dy(t)
dt

≥ f((y(t)),

t ≥ 0

fi(x1 + a1, · · · , xi−1 + ai−1, xi, xi+1 + ai+1, · · · , xn + an) ≥ fi(x1, · · · , xn),

i = 1, · · · , n.

Then y(t) ≥ x(t) for t ≥ 0.

For fundamental knowledge on ﬁxed point theory, see Ref. [40].

Lemma 2. (Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, see Theorem 4.10 in [40]) Let D be a nonempty, bounded, closed and

convex subset of Rn, and let f : D → D be a continuous function. Then f has a ﬁxed point.

For fundamental knowledge on matrix theory, see Ref. [41]. Let diag(ai) denote the diagonal matrix with diagnoal

entries a1, a2, · · · , aN, and let col(ai) denote the column vector of components a1, a2, · · · , aN. This paper considers

only real square matrices. For a matrix A, let s(A) denote the maximum real part of an eigenvalue of A. A is Metzler

if its oﬀ-diagonal entries are all nonnegative.

Lemma 3. (Section 2.1 in [42]) Let A be an irreducible Metzler matrix. Then the following claims hold.

(a) If there is a positive vector x such that Ax < λx, then s(A) < λ.

(b) If there is a positive vector x such that Ax = λx, then s(A) = λ.

(c) If there is a positive vector x such that Ax > λx, then s(A) > λ.

3.2. A preliminary result

For the GSCS model, let

Ci =

αxi
αxi + γδyizi

, Ci =

αxi + f (β (cid:80)N
j=1 a ji)
αxi + γδyizi + f (β (cid:80)N

,

i = 1, · · · , N.

The following lemma will be useful in the subsequent study.

Lemma 4. Let C(t) = (C1(t), C2(t), · · · , CN(t))T be a solution to the SCS model. Then there are t0 > 0 and c > 0 such

that

Proof. Without loss of generality, assume xi0 > 0. It follows from the GSCS model that

The lemma follows by repeating the argument.

3.3. The equilibrium

Theorem 1. The GSCS model admits a unique equilibrium. Denote this equilibrium by C∗ = (C∗

1, · · · , C∗

N)T . Then

i > 0, Ci ≤ C∗
C∗

i ≤ Ci, 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

Proof. Let K = (cid:81)N
i=1

(cid:104)
Ci, Ci

(cid:105)
. Deﬁne a continuous mapping H = (H1, · · · , HN)T : K → [0, 1]N as follows.

Hi(w) =

αxi + f (β (cid:80)N
αxi + γδyizi + f (β (cid:80)N

j=1 a jiw j)

j=1 a jiw j)

, w = (w1, · · · , wN)T ∈ K.

It is trivial to show that C is an equilibrium of the GSCS model if and only if C is a ﬁxed point of H. Furthermore, it is

easy to show that H maps K into itself. It follows from Lemma 2 that H has a ﬁxed point, denoted C∗ = (C∗

This implies that C∗ is an equilibrium of the GSCS model, where Ci ≤ C∗

C∗

i > 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

The remaining thing to do is to show that C∗ is the unique ﬁxed point of H. On the contrary, suppose H has a ﬁxed

point other than C∗. Denote this equilibrium by C∗∗ = (C∗∗

This contradicts the assumption that C∗

. Hence, C∗ is the unique ﬁxed point of H. The proof is complete.

3.4. The stability of the equilibrium

Theorem 2. The equilibrium C∗ of the GSCS model is stable with recpect to Ω.

Proof. Let C(t) = (C1(t), C2(t), · · · , CN(t))T be a solution to the GSCS model. By Lemma 4, there are t0 > 0 and

c > 0 such that

Let

Deﬁne a function V as

Ci(t) ≥ c,

t ≥ t0.

Z(C(t)) = max
1≤i≤N

Ci(t)

z(C(t)) = min

Ci(t)
C∗
i

,

t ≥ t0.

V(C(t)) = max{Z(C(t)) − 1, 0} + max{1 − z(C(t)), 0}.

It is easily veriﬁed that V is positive deﬁnite with respect to C∗, i.e., (a) V(C(t)) ≥ 0, and (b) V(C(t)) = 0 if and only
if C(t) = C∗. Next , let us show that D+V(C(t)) ≤ 0, t ≥ t0, where D+ stands for the upper-right Dini derivative of V

along C(t). To this end, we need to show the following two claims.

Claim 1: D+Z(C(t)) ≤ 0 if Z(C(t)) ≥ 1. Moreover, D+Z(C(t)) < 0 if Z(C(t)) > 1.

Claim 2: D+z(C(t)) ≥ 0 if z(C(t)) ≤ 1. Moreover, D+z(C(t)) > 0 if z(C(t)) < 1. Here D+ stands for the lower-right

Dini derivative.

Proof of Claim 1: Choose k0 such that

= 0,

where the second inequality follows from the concavity of f , and the third inequality follows from the monotonicity
of f . This implies D+Z(C(t)) ≤ 0. As the ﬁrst inequality is strict if Z(C(t)) > 1, we get that D+Z(C(t)) < 0 if

Z(C(t)) > 1. Claim 1 is proven.

The argument for Claim 2 is analogous to that for Claim 1 and hence is omitted. Next, consider three possibilities.
Case 1: Z(C(t)) < 1. Then z(C(t)) < 1, V(C(t)) = 1 − z(C(t)). Hence, D+V(C(t)) = −D+z(C(t)) < 0.
Case 2: z(C(t)) > 1. Then Z(C(t)) > 1, V(C(t)) = Z(C(t)) − 1. Hence, D+V(C(t)) = D+Z(C(t)) < 0.
Case 3: Z(C(t)) ≥ 1, z(C(t)) ≤ 1. Then V(C(t)) = Z(C(t)) − z(C(t)), D+V(C(t)) = D+Z(C(t)) − D+z(C(t)) ≤ 0.

Moreover, the equality holds if and only if C(t) = C∗.

The theorem follows from the LaSalle Invariance Principle.

Let C(t) denote the expected fraction of compromised nodes in the cyber network at time t, C∗ the expected

fraction of compromised nodes in the cyber network when the expected network state is C∗.

The following result is a corollary of Theorem 2.

Corollary 1. Consider the GSCS model (1). Then C(t) → C∗ as t → ∞.

Obviously, C∗ is dependent upon the four technical levels, the interconnection network, and the attack and defense

schemes. We refer to the four technical levels and the interconnection network as parameters, because they are almost

ﬁxed. We refer to the attack and defense schemes as independent variables, because the attack scheme is ﬂexibly

choosable by the attacker, and the defense scheme is ﬂexibly choosable by the defender. Formally,

C∗ = C∗(x, y, z; α, β, δ, γ, G).

3.5. The limit security of cyber networks

In practice, C∗ can be estimated simply through sampling and averaging. This method for estimating C∗ is valu-

able, because it does not require the defender to know the attack and infection tecnical levels as well as the attack

scheme. Therefore, C∗ can be used to evaluate the security of the cyber network. Below let us deﬁne a security metric

of cyber networks under APTs.

Deﬁnition 1. Given the four technical levels, the interconnected network, the attack scheme and the defense scheme,

the limit security of the cyber network is deﬁned as

S L = 1 − C∗,

(3)

This security metric of cyber networks is rational, because the higher the limit security, the securer the cyber

network would be. The limit security is dependent upon the four technical levels, the interconnection network, the

attack scheme and the defense scheme. Formally,

C∗ = C∗(x, y, z; α, β, δ, γ, G).

4. The inﬂuence of some factors on the limit security of a cyber network

In this section, we theoretically investigate the inﬂuence of some factors, including the technical levels, the attack

and defense resources per unit time per node, and the addition of new edges to the interconnection network, on the

limit security of a cyber network. For this purpose, deﬁne an irreducible Metzler matrix as follows.

It follows from Lemma 3(a) that s(M) < 0. This implies that M is invertible. As M is Metzler, irreducible and

where M−1 is negative. As G is strongly connected, AT C∗ is positive. Hence, ∂C∗

∂β > 0.

As a corollary of this theorem, the inﬂuence of the four technical levels on the limit security of a cyber network is

shown as follows.

Corollary 2. For the GSCS model (1), we have ∂S L

∂α < 0, ∂S L

∂β < 0, ∂S L

∂γ > 0, ∂S L

∂δ > 0.

This corollary manifests that the limit security of a cyber network goes up with the prevention and recovery

technical levels, and comes down with the attack and infection technical levels. These results accord with our intuition.

Hence, the defender must try his best to enhance the prevention and recovery technical levels.

4.2. The inﬂuence of the attack and defense resources per unit time per node

Theorem 4. For the GSCS model (1), we have ∂C∗
∂xi

> 0, ∂C∗
∂yi

< 0, ∂C∗
∂zi

< 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

The argument for the theorem is analogous to that for the previous theorem. As a corollary of this theorem, the

inﬂuence of the attack and defense resources per unit time per node on the limit security of a cyber network is shown

as follows.

Corollary 3. For the GSCS model (1), we have ∂S L
∂xi

< 0, ∂S L
∂yi

> 0, ∂S L
∂zi

> 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

This corollary demonstrates that the limit security of a cyber network rises with the resource per unit time used

for preventing or recovering a node, and falls with the resource per unit time used for attacking a node. Again, these

results are consistent with our intuition. As a consequence, the defender is suggested to conﬁgure more defense

resource.

11

4.3. The inﬂuence of the addition of new edges to the interconnection network

Theorem 5. For the GSCS model, we have ∂C∗
∂ai j

> 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N, i (cid:44) j.

The argument for the theorem is analogous to that for Theorem 3. As a corollary of this theorem, the addition of

new edges to the interconnection network on the limit security of a cyber network is shown as follows.

Corollary 4. For the GSCS model (1), we have ∂S L
∂ai j

< 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N, i (cid:44) j.

This corollary manifests that the limit security of a cyber network declines with the addition of new edges to the

interconnection network. Hence, a well-connected cyber network is more vulnerable to APTs. Therefore, the defender

is suggested to limit the number of connections in the interconnection network.

5. The inﬂuence of two other factors on the limit security of a cyber network

In this section, we experimentally examine the inﬂuence of two factors, the ratio of the prevention resource to

the recovery resource, and the defense resource per unit time with given ratio of the attack resource to the defense

resource, on the limit security of a cyber network. In the following experiments, the generic function in the GSCS

model is set to be f (x) = x

1+x , and the interconnection network takes value from a set of six non-isomorphic trees

shown in Fig. 2.

5.1. The inﬂuence of the ratio of the prevention resource to the recovery resource

For a GSCS model, the ratio of the prevention resource to the recovery resource is

rPR =

||y||1
||z||1

.

We examine the inﬂuence of rPR on the limit security of a cyber network through simulation experiments.

Experiment 1. Consider 504 GSCS models, where α = 0.05, β = 0.01, γ = 1, δ = 1, G varies from G1 to G6,
||x||1 = 1, ||y||1 = r

2 , 1, 2, 3, 4}, with (a) uniform x, y and z; (b) uniform x and y, degree-ﬁrst

z; (j) degree-last x, uniform y, degree-ﬁrst z; (k) degree-last x, degree-ﬁrst y, uniform z; (l) degree-last x, degree-ﬁrst

y and z. For each of the GSCS model, the limit security of the cyber network is shown shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen

that, with the increase of rPR, the limit security of a cyber network goes up ﬁrst but then it goes down. Moreover, the
limit security attains the maximum in the proximity of rPR = 1.

Many similar experiments exhibit qualitatively similar phenomena. It is concluded that, with the increase of the

ratio of the prevention resource to the recovery resource, the limit security of a cyber network goes up ﬁrst but then it

goes down. Moreover, the limit security attains the maximum when the prevention resource is close to the recovery

resource. Hence, the defender is suggested to distribute the total defense resource equally to prevention and recovery.

then it goes down. Moreover, the limit security attains the maximum in the proximity of rPR = 1.

5.2. The inﬂuence of defense resource per unit time given the ratio of the attack resource to the defense resource

For a GSCS model, the ratio of the attack resource to the defense resource is

rAD =

||x||1
||y||1 + ||z||1

.

Obviously, the limit security of a cyber network declines with rAD. A question arises naturally: given the ratio of the

attack resource to the defense resource, how about the impact of the defense resource on the limit security of a cyber

network? Now, let us answer the question through simulation experiments.

It can be seen that the limit security of a cyber network ascends with s.

Many similar experiments exhibit qualitatively similar phenomena. It is concluded that, given the ratio of the

attack resource to the defense resource, the limit security of a cyber network goes up with the defense resource. This

result sounds a good news to the defender. Indeed, conﬁguring more defense resource is always an eﬀective means of

protecting against APTs.

6. Concluding remarks

This paper is devoted to measuring the security of cyber networks under APTs. An APT-based cyber attack-

defense process has been modeled as a dynamical system, which is shown to exhibit the global stability. Thereby, the

limit security has been introduced as a new security metric of cyber networks. The inﬂuence of diﬀerent factors on

the limit security has been expounded. On this basis, some means of defending against APTs are recommended.

There are lots of open problems about APTs. In the case that the attack scheme is available, the defender must

When the

attack scheme is not avaliable, the defender should furher minimize this maximized limit security over all possible

attack schemes, so as to evaluate the worst-case security of the cyber network. In this work, the attack and defense

schemes are both assumed to be unvaried over time. In practice, the attacker may ﬂexibly alter the attack scheme to

chase the highest proﬁt, and the defender may ﬂexibly change the defense scheme to maximize the security of the

cyber network. In such scenarios, the evaluation of the security of cyber networks would involve optimal control

theory [44–46] or/and dynamic game theory [47, 48].
