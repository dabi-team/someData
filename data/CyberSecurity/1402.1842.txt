ABSTRACT 

Cyber Security plays an important role in the field of information technology .Securing the information 
have  become  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  in  the  present  day.  When  ever  we  think  about  the  cyber 
security the first thing that comes to our mind is ‘cyber crimes’ which are increasing immensely day by 
day.  Various  Governments  and  companies  are  taking  many  measures  in  order to  prevent these  cyber 
crimes. Besides various measures cyber security is still a very big concern to many. This paper mainly 
focuses on challenges faced by cyber security on the latest technologies .It also focuses on latest about 
the cyber security techniques, ethics and the trends changing the face of cyber security. 

Keywords: cyber security, cyber crime, cyber ethics, social media, cloud computing, android apps. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Today man is able to send and receive any form 
of  data  may  be  an  e-mail  or  an  audio  or  video 
just  by  the  click  of  a  button  but  did  he  ever 
think how securely his data id being transmitted 
or  sent  to  the  other  person  safely  without  any 
leakage  of  information??  The  answer  lies  in 
cyber  security.  Today  Internet  is  the  fastest 
growing  infrastructure  in  every  day  life.  In 
today’s 
latest 
technical  environment  many 
technologies  are  changing  the  face  of  the  man 
kind.  But  due  to  these  emerging  technologies 
we  are  unable 
to  safeguard  our  private 
information  in  a  very  effective  way  and  hence 
these  days  cyber  crimes  are  increasing  day  by 
day.  Today  more  than  60  percent  of  total 
commercial transactions are done online, so this 
field  required  a  high  quality  of  security  for 
transparent  and  best  transactions.  Hence  cyber 
security has become a latest issue. The scope of 
cyber security is not just limited to securing the 
information  in  IT  industry  but  also  to  various 
other fields like cyber space etc. 

the

technologies 

 Even 
like  cloud 
computing, mobile computing, E-commerce, net 
banking  etc  also  needs  high  level  of  security. 
Since  these  technologies  hold  some  important 
information  regarding  a  person  their  security 
has  become  a  must  thing.  Enhancing  cyber 
security  and  protecting  critical 
information 
infrastructures  are  essential  to  each  nation's 
security  and  economic  wellbeing.  Making  the 
Internet safer (and protecting Internet users) has 
become  integral  to  the  development  of  new

nations  and  governments  are  imposing  strict 
laws on cyber securities  in order to prevent the 
loss  of  some  important  information.  Every

2. CYBER CRIME 

Cyber crime is a term for any illegal activity that 
uses  a  computer  as  its  primary  means  of 
commission  and  theft.  The  U.S.  Department  of 
Justice expands the definition of  cyber crime to 
include any illegal activity that uses a computer 
for the storage of  evidence. The growing  list of 
cyber  crimes  includes  crimes  that  have  been 
made  possible  by  computers,  such  as  network 
intrusions  and  the  dissemination  of  computer 
viruses, as well as computer-based variations of 
as identity 
existing 
theft, stalking, bullying 
and terrorism  which 
have  become  as  major  problem  to  people  and 
nations.  Usually  in  common  man’s  language 
cyber crime may be defined as crime committed 
using  a  computer  and  the  internet  to  steel  a 
person’s  identity  or  sell  contraband  or  stalk 
victims  or  disrupt  operations  with  malevolent 

crimes,

in major role in a person’s life the cyber crimes 
also  will  increase  along  with  the  technological 
advances.

threat  to  both  their  data  and  their  business 
continuity. 

3. CYBER SECURITY 

Privacy  and  security  of  the  data  will  always  be 
top  security  measures  that  any  organization 
takes  care.  We  are  presently  living  in  a  world 
where  all  the  information  is  maintained  in  a 
digital or a cyber  form.  Social  networking sites 
provide  a  space  where  users  feel  safe  as  they 
interact  with  friends  and  family.  In  the  case  of 
home  users,  cyber-criminals  would  continue  to 
target  social  media  sites  to  steal  personal  data. 
Not only social networking but also during bank 
transactions  a  person  must take  all  the  required 
security measures.

There will be new attacks on Android operating 
system  based  devices,  but  it  will  not  be  on 
massive  scale.  The  fact  tablets  share  the  same 
operating  system  as  smart  phones  means  they 
will  be  soon  targeted  by  the  same  malware  as 
those  platforms.  The  number  of  malware 
specimens  for  Macs  would  continue  to  grow, 
though  much  less  than  in  the  case  of  PCs. 
Windows  8  will  allow  users 
to  develop 
applications  for  virtually  any  device  (PCs, 
tablets  and  smart  phones)  running  Windows  8, 
so  it  will  be  possible  to  develop  malicious 
applications  like those for Android, hence these 
are  some  of  the  predicted  trends  in  cyber 
security.

The  above  Comparison  of  Cyber  Security 
Incidents  reported  to  Cyber999  in  Malaysia 
from  January–June  2012  and  2013  clearly 
exhibits  the  cyber  security  threats.  As  crime  is 
increasing  even  the  security  measures  are  also 
increasing.  According  to  the  survey  of  U.S. 

criminals  distribute 

The  threat  of  attacks  on  web  applications  to

persists.  Cyber 
malicious  code  via

they’ve compromised. But data-stealing attacks, 
many  of  which  get  the  attention  of  media,  are 
also  a  big  threat.   Now,  we  need  a  greater 
emphasis  on  protecting  web  servers  and  web 
applications. Web servers are especially the best 
platform  for  these  cyber  criminals  to  steal  the 
data.  Hence  one  must  always  use  a  safer 
browser especially during important transactions 
in order not to fall as a prey for these crimes.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2 Cloud computing and its services 

These  days  all  small,  medium  and 
large 
companies  are  slowly  adopting  cloud  services. 
In  other  words  the  world  is  slowly  moving 
towards  the  clouds.  This  latest  trend  presents  a 
big  challenge  for  cyber  security,  as  traffic  can 
go  around  traditional  points  of 
inspection. 
Additionally,  as  the  number  of  applications 
available in the cloud grows, policy controls for 
web  applications  and  cloud  services  will  also 
need  to  evolve  in  order  to  prevent  the  loss  of 
valuable information. Though cloud services are 
developing their own models still a lot of issues 
are being brought up about their security. Cloud 
may  provide 
it 
should always be noted that as the cloud evolves 
so as its security concerns increase. 
4.3 APT’s and targeted attacks 

immense  opportunities  but 

APT  (Advanced  Persistent  Threat)  is  a  whole 
new  level  of  cyber  crime  ware.  For  years 
network  security  capabilities  such  as  web 
filtering  or  IPS  have  played  a  key  part  in 
identifying  such  targeted  attacks  (mostly  after 
the  initial  compromise).  As  attackers  grow 
bolder  and  employ  more  vague  techniques, 
network  security  must  integrate  with  other 
security  services  in  order  to  detect  attacks. 
Hence one must improve our security techniques 
in  order  to  prevent  more  threats  coming  in  the 
future. 

4.4 Mobile Networks 

Today  we  are  able  to  connect  to  anyone  in  any 
part of the world. But for these mobile networks 
security  is  a  very  big  concern.  These  days 
firewalls  and  other  security  measures  are 
becoming  porous  as  people  are  using  devices 
such  as  tablets,  phones,  PC’s  etc  all  of  which 
again  require  extra  securities  apart  from  those 
present  in  the  applications  used.  We  must 
always  think  about  the  security  issues  of  these 
mobile  networks.  Further  mobile  networks  are 
highly prone to these cyber crimes a  lot of care 
must be taken in case of their security issues. 

4.5 IPv6: New internet protocol 

IPv6  is  the  new  Internet  protocol  which  is 
replacing  IPv4  (the  older  version),  which  has 
been a backbone of our networks in general and 
the Internet at large. Protecting IPv6 is not just a 
question  of  porting  IPv4  capabilities.  While 
IPv6 is a wholesale replacement in making more 
IP  addresses  available,  there  are  some  very 
fundamental changes to the protocol which need  

to  be  considered  in  security  policy.  Hence  it  is 
always  better  to  switch  to  IPv6  as  soon  as 
possible  in  order  to  reduce  the  risks  regarding 
cyber crime. 

4.6 Encryption of the code

information) 

Encryption is  the  process of  encoding  messages 
(or 
that 
eavesdroppers  or  hackers  cannot  read  it.. In  an 
encryption  scheme,  the  message  or  information 
is  encrypted  using  an  encryption  algorithm, 
turning  it  into an unreadable cipher text. This  is 
usually  done  with  the  use of  an encryption  key, 
which  specifies  how  the  message  is  to  be 
encoded. Encryption  at  a  very  beginning  level 
protects data privacy and its integrity. But more 
use  of  encryption  brings  more  challenges  in 
cyber security. Encryption is also used to protect 
for  example  data  being 
data 
the Internet, e-
transferred  via networks (e.g. 
commerce), mobile 
telephones, wireless 
microphones, wireless  intercoms  etc.  Hence  by 
encrypting the code one can know if there is any 
leakage of information.

Hence  the  above  are  some  of  the  trends 
changing the face of cyber security in the world.

The above pie chart shows about the major 
threats for networks and cyber security. 

5. ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN 
CYBER SECURITY 

As  we  become  more  social  in  an  increasingly 
connected  world,  companies  must  find  new 
ways  to  protect  personal  information. Social 
media  plays  a  huge  role  in  cyber  security  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will  contribute  a  lot  to  personal  cyber  threats. 
Social  media  adoption  among  personnel 
is 
skyrocketing and so is the threat of attack. Since 
social  media  or  social  networking  sites  are 
almost  used  by  most  of  them  every  day  it  has 
become a huge platform  for the cyber criminals 
for  hacking  private  information  and  stealing 
valuable data.  

In  a  world  where  we’re  quick  to  give  up  our 
personal  information, companies have to ensure 
they’re  just  as  quick  in  identifying  threats, 
responding  in  real  time,  and  avoiding  a  breach 
of any kind. Since people are easily attracted by 
these social media the hackers use them as a bait 
to get the information and the data they require. 
Hence  people  must  take  appropriate  measures 
especially  in  dealing  with  social  media  in  order 
to prevent the loss of their information. 
The  ability  of  individuals  to  share  information 
with an audience of millions is at the heart of the 
particular challenge that social media presents to 
businesses.  In  addition  to  giving  anyone  the 
power  to  disseminate  commercially  sensitive 
information,  social  media  also  gives  the  same 
power to spread false information, which can be 
just  being  as  damaging.  The  rapid  spread  of 
false information through social media is among 
the  emerging  risks  identified in Global  Risks 
2013 report. 

Though  social  media  can  be  used  for  cyber 
crimes  these  companies  cannot  afford  to  stop 
using  social  media  as  it  plays  an  important  role 
in  publicity  of  a  company.   Instead,  they  must 
have solutions that will notify them of the threat 
in order to fix it before any real damage is done. 
However companies should understand this and 
recognise 
the 
information  especially  in  social  conversations 
and  provide  appropriate  security  solutions  in 
order to stay away  from risks. One  must handle 
social  media  by  using  certain  policies  and  right 
technologies.

should  be  checked  if  it  has  originated  from  a 
trusted  and  a  reliable  source  and  that  they  are 
not  altered.  Authenticating  of  these  documents 
is usually done by the anti virus software present 
in the devices. Thus a good anti virus software is 
also essential to protect the devices from viruses. 

6.3 Malware scanners 

This  is  software  that  usually  scans  all  the  files 
and  documents  present 
the  system  for 
malicious  code  or  harmful  viruses.   Viruses, 
worms,  and  Trojan  horses  are  examples  of 
that  are  often  grouped 
malicious  software 
together and referred to as malware.

6.4 Firewalls 

A  firewall  is  a  software  program  or  piece  of 
hardware that helps screen out hackers, viruses, 
and worms that try to reach your computer over 
the  Internet.   All  messages  entering  or  leaving 
the  internet  pass  through  the  firewall  present, 
which examines each  message and  blocks those 
that  do  not  meet  the  specified security criteria. 
Hence  firewalls  play  an  important  role  in 
detecting the malware. 

6.5 Anti-virus software 

Antivirus  software  is  a  computer  program  that 
detects,  prevents,  and  takes  action  to  disarm  or 
remove  malicious  software  programs,  such  as 
viruses  and  worms.  Most  antivirus  programs 
include  an  auto-update  feature  that  enables  the 
program to download profiles of new viruses so 
that it can check  for the new viruses as  soon as 
they are discovered.  An anti virus software is a 
must and basic necessity for every system. 

6. CYBER SECURITY TECHNIQUES 

6.1 Access control and password security 

The  concept  of  user  name  and  password  has 
been 
fundamental  way  of  protecting  our 
information.  This  may  be  one  of  the  first 
measures regarding cyber security. 

6.2 Authentication of data 

The  documents that  we receive  must  always  be 
authenticated  be  before  downloading  that  is  it

7 CYBER ETHICS 

Cyber  ethics  are  nothing  but  the  code  of  the

there  are  good  chances  of  us  using  the  internet 
in a proper and safer way. The below are a few 
of them:

how  they  secure  their  infrastructure,  but  how 
they  require  new  platforms  and  intelligence  to 
do  so.  There  is  no  perfect  solution  for  cyber 
crimes  but  we  should  try  our  level  best  to 
minimize  them  in  order  to  have  a  safe  and 
secure future in cyber space.

Computer  security 
is  a  vast  topic  that  is 
becoming  more  important  because  the  world  is 
becoming  highly  interconnected,  with  networks 
being  used  to  carry  out  critical  transactions. 
Cyber crime continues to diverge down different 
paths  with  each  New  Year  that  passes  and  so 
does  the  security  of  the  information.  The  latest
