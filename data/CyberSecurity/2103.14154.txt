Abstract—Smart  grid  monitoring,  automation  and  control 
will  completely  rely  on  PMU  based  sensor  data  soon. 
Accordingly,  a  high  throughput,  low  latency  Information  and 
Communication  Technology  (ICT)  infrastructure  should  be 
opted  in  this  regard.  Due  to  the  low  cost,  low  power  profile, 
dynamic  nature,  improved  accuracy  and  scalability,  wireless 
sensor networks (WSNs) can be a good choice. Yet, the efficiency 
of a WSN depends a lot on the network design and the routing 
technique.  In this paper a new design of the ICT network for 
smart grid using WSN is proposed. In order to understand the 
interactions between different entities, detect their operational 
levels,  design  the  routing  scheme  and  identify  false  data 
injection  by  particular  ICT  entities,  a  new  model  of 
interdependency 
Implicative 
Interdependency  Model  (MSIIM)  is  proposed  in  this  paper, 
which  is  an  updated  version  of  the  Modified  Implicative 
Interdependency Model (MIIM)  [1]. MSIIM considers the data 
dependency and operational accuracy of entities together with 
structural and functional dependencies between them. A multi-
path  secure  routing  technique  is  also  proposed  in  this  paper 
which relies on the MSIIM model for its functioning. Simulation 
results  prove  that  MSIIM  based  False  Data  Injection  (FDI) 
detection and mitigation works better and faster than  existing 
methods.

I.  INTRODUCTION   

Remote  monitoring  of  the  power  grid  by  means  of  the 
Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition  (SCADA)  have 
been in practice for a long time. In order to improve the remote 
monitoring of the power network and fructify the concept of a 
smart grid, current and voltage sensors are further updated to 
develop  more  advanced  devices  like  Phasor  Measurement 
Units  (PMUs)  [2]  which  have  a  sensing  module,  a  data 
processing module, a memory and a communication module. 
Output from the processing module of the PMU is sent to the 
communication module and finally to the network to be sent 
to the control centers (CCs). These PMUs sample current and 
voltage phases at the rate of 48 samples per cycle and send 30 
samples  per  second.  CCs  use  these  PMU  data  to  perform  a 
number  of  analytical  tasks  like  state  estimation,  to  estimate 
voltage stability margin, to validate generator model, generate 
a contingency list [3] for the network and so on. This brings 
the need for a fast and secure communication network to carry 

the PMU data from the substations to the CCs with minimum 
delay and in a secure manner.  

In order to achieve these goals, researchers are trying to 
find the best suited design of the ICT infrastructure for smart 
grid systems. The authors of [1] provide a realistic design of 
the ICT infrastructure for smart grid with inputs from a power 
utility  in  the  U.S.  Southwest,  but  it  is  a  completely  wired 
network with fiber optic cables using SONET-over-Ethernet 
and Ethernet-over-DWDM. Such a communication network is 
neither cost effective nor energy saving as every entity draws 
power from the grid to operate. Furthermore, addition of new 
ICT components and isolation of the same is also difficult in 
such a network. 

Since  smart  sensors  like  PMUs  are  already  gaining 
popularity in the remote monitoring of power grid, a sensor 
network based ICT network design [4] became an easy choice 
for the researchers. Therefore, in this paper, a WSN based ICT 
network design for smart grid system is presented. Yet, WSNs 
are  vulnerable  to  cyber-attacks  and  the  proposed  network 
design  should  be  accompanied  with  an  efficient  and  secure 
routing scheme to serve the purpose of pervasive monitoring 
of  the  power  network.  In  order  to  do  that,  a  clear 
understanding of the interactions between the different entities 
of  the  smart  grid  system  is  very  important.  In  [1],  an 
interdependency  model,  named  as  the  Modified  Implicative 
Interdependency  Model  (MIIM)  is  proposed  that  very 
accurately depicts the interdependencies between the different 
types of entities in the smart grid and also takes into account 
the  interactions  between  them  to  determine  the  operational 
state  of  each  such  entity.  MIIM  uses  Boolean  logic  based 
equations called Inter-Dependency Relations (IDRs) to model 
the structural and functional dependencies between entities in 
a smart grid. Just by solving such IDRs, the operational level 
of  an  entity  can  be  identified.  However, by  solving  IDRs  it 
cannot be predicted if the data received from an operational 
entity  is  correct  or  it  has  false  data  injected  into  it.  CCs 
completely  depend  on  the  data  carried  to  it  by  the 
communication  system  from  the  PMUs  to  make  all  the 
required  analysis.  However,  such  data  dependency  is  not 
covered in the dependency model MIIM [1].  

On the other hand, cyber-attacks like False Data Injection 
(FDI) is very common in the communication system of a smart 
grid.  Cyber  science  researchers  mainly  focus  on  recovering 
the actual data [5] after a FDI attack takes place to perform 
state  estimation.  However,  such  processes  are  not  only 

 
complex but also, they are time consuming. A better way of 
arresting  FDI  attack  can  be  identifying  the  attack  before  it 
reaches the CCs and thereby detecting the source of the attack, 
so  that  the  source  can  be  completely  avoided  for  further 
communications.  In  this  paper,  an  updated  version  of  the 
MIIM is proposed as Multi-State Implicative Interdependency 
Model  (MSIIM)  which  together  with  the  structural  and 
functional  dependencies  also  takes  into  account  the  data 
dependency  between  the  ICT  entities  of  the  smart  grid. 
MSIIM ensures operational accuracy of the entities in the ICT 
network.  A  novel  multi-path  data  routing  technique  is  also 
proposed in this paper which prevents FDI attacks and even if 
an attack takes place, that can be identified in the path to the 
CC and by solving the MSIIM IDRs, the source of the attack 
can be detected.  

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
gives  a  brief  description  of  the  WSN  based  ICT  network 
design  for  a  smart  grid  of  IEEE  14-Bus  system.  Section  III 
gives an overview of the dependency model MSIIM. Routing 
of PMU data from the substations to the CCs is described in 
detail in section IV. Section V gives the simulation results and 
the paper concludes in section VI.  

II.  DESIGN OF WSN BASED ICT NETWORK FOR SMART GRID  

A  generic  ICT  network  design  for  smart  grid  system  is 
proposed in this section considering IEEE 14-Bus system as 
the power grid.  This design  can be applied  on  larger power 
grids. Fig.1. shows all the power and communication entities 
in a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus. 

Before  deciding  on  the  design  of  the  ICT  network,  the 
power grid is divided into a number of substations as in [1]. In 
Fig.1., there are a total of 11 substations denoted by 𝑆𝑖 where 
i is the substation ID. Now, in order to efficiently monitor the 
power  grid,  the  whole  network  area  is  first  divided  into  a 
number of regions. In order to do that, the connectivity of each 
of the substations located at the borders of the network region 
is calculated. Starting from a substation 𝑆𝑖 with the maximum 
the  border  substations,  all  other 
connectivity  among 
substations  within  a  given  distance  of  it,  are  marked  as 
substations of a common monitoring region 𝑅𝑥. Then the next 
substation which is  closest to 𝑆𝑖  but beyond the given distance 
and  is  not  yet  placed  in  a  region,  is  selected  and  the  same 
process  is  repeated.  This  process  is  continued  till  every 
substation is placed within a monitoring region. Fig 1. shows 
that after this process is completed, the smart grid network for 
IEEE 14-Bus system is divided into 4 regions. 

The substation 𝑆𝑖 having the maximum connectivity with 
other substations is selected as the main CC for the smart grid 
and that having the second highest connectivity is selected as 
the backup CC. If the communication entities of the main CC 
fail, the backup CC can still continue the remote monitoring 
of the smart grid system.  

The WSN is used in the proposed ICT design to send the 
huge  volume  of  PMU  data  from  the  PMU  containing 
substations  to  the  CCs.  PMUs  are  placed  in  some  of  the 
substations following the optimal PMU placement algorithm 
in [6]. In Fig.1, PMUs (𝑈𝑖) are shown by green diamonds on 
the  buses.  Each  substation  has  a  substation  gateway  (𝐺𝑊𝑖) 
which is responsible for receiving PMU data and SCADA data 
from the PMUs and RTUs of that substation respectively. A 

region  is  provided  with  a  Phasor  Data  Concentrator  (PDC), 
only if it has a 𝑈𝑖 containing substation. In the smart grid of 
IEEE 14-Bus, PDCs are placed in region 1 and 3 only. Energy 
Harvesting Relay Nodes (EHRNs) denoted by 𝑅𝑖 in fig.1., are 
densely  deployed  over  the  network  area,  mainly  near  the 
PDCs,  and  the  𝑈𝑖  containing  substations.  𝑈𝑖  data  from  the 
substations  are  carried  to  the  PDC  of  that  region  by  the 
EHRNs following a multipath routing technique discussed in 
section  IV.  There  is  a  dedicated  optical  fiber  channel  from 
each PDC to each of the CC-gateways. The CCs are provided 
with  servers  which  are  connected  to  the  CC-gateways  via 
LAN. 𝑈𝑖 data from all over the smart grid is sent to the CC-
servers as they are received by the CC-gateways. The utility 
operators rely on the CC-servers to perform different analysis 
including  state  estimation.  The 
two  CC-gateways  are 
connected by a fiber optic cable. 

III.  OVERVIEW OF MULTI STATE IMPLICATIVE 
INTERDEPENDENCY MODEL (MSIIM) 

The smart grid system can be viewed as a joint power and 
ICT network. In both MIIM [1] and MSIIM, the  smart grid 
can be represented as a set 𝐽(𝐸, 𝐹(𝐸)) where 𝐸 = 𝑃 ∪ 𝐶 ∪ 𝐶𝑃 
denoting the set of all entities in the smart grid. P denotes the 
set of all power entities; C denotes the set of communication 
entities and CP denotes entities belonging to both the layers 
like  PMUs.  F(E)  represents  the  set  of  IDRs.  All  the  power 
entities in both the models are denoted as P type entities where 
𝑃 = {𝑃1, 𝑃2, … 𝑃𝑛} and the communication entities are C type 
entities where 𝐶 = {𝐶1, 𝐶2, … 𝐶𝑚}. In MIIM, the set F(E) only 
captures the  structural and functional dependencies between 
the entities in the smart grid.  

In  MSIIM, 

together  with  structural,  functional  or 
operational  dependencies, 
the  data  dependency  and 
operational  accuracy  is  also  taken  into  account  while 
formulating the IDRs in set F(E). In MIIM, any entity can take 
a  value  of  0,  1  and  2;  indicating  no  operation,  reduced 
operation  and  full  operation  respectively.  The  novelty  of 
MIIM lies in the fact that it considers a reduced operational 
level of the smart grid entities which is a very common feature 
of  them.  However,  even  if  a  communication  entity  is  fully 
operational, it may not deliver correct data to the entity in the 
next hop due to node compromise by attacker. Also, the  CP 
type entities like 𝑈𝑖s can send wrong readings to the CCs. This 
might lead to a wrong analysis of the system state by the CCs 
and  thereby compel  the operator  to  take  wrong decision.  In 
MSIIM,  the  P  type  entities  can  take  the  same  3  states  as 
described in MIIM, but the state values are 3 for full operation, 
2 for reduced operation and 0 for no operation. The C and CP 
type  entities  can  take  four  different  states  in  MSIIM  as  the 
reduced  operation  is  further  categorized  into  two  types, 
namely─  operation  reduced  by  false  data  and  operation 
entities. 
reduced 
Therefore, the four different states of C and CP type entities 
in  MSIIM  are  denoted  by─  0  indicating  no-operation,  1 
indicating  reduced  operation  by  false  data,  2  indicating 
reduced operation by interdependent non-operational entities 
and 3 indicating full operation. 

non-operational 

interdependent 

by 

In MSIIM the same three new Boolean operators are used 
as MIIM [1], except the inputs and outputs can range from 0 
to 3 in place of 0 to 2. The truth table for the 3 operators in 
MSIIM are given in Table I.  

Fig. 1.  Power and Communication Entities in a smart grid system of IEEE 14-Bus 

In  order  to  explain  the  difference  between  the  two 
dependency models, a dependency between C type and P type 
entities  is  considered  as  follows.    𝐶𝑖,  a  C  type  entity,  be 
operational if  (i) 𝐶𝑗 which is another communication entity 
and 𝑃𝑎 which is a P type, are operational, or (ii) 𝐶𝑘 which is 
another C type entity and 𝑃𝑏 which is another P type entity are 
operational, and (iii) 𝐶𝑙 which is an entity in communication 
layer is operational. Now, let us assume that even if an entity 
in condition  (i) or (ii) fails,  𝐶𝑖 will still work full operability, 
but  if  (iii)  is  not  satisfied  then  𝐶𝑖 will  operate  at  a  reduced 
level; this relation can be expressed using MIIM  an MSIIM 
IDRs as: 𝐶𝑖 ← ((𝐶𝑗   ○   𝑃𝑎) ● (𝐶𝑘   ○   𝑃𝑏)) ◉ 𝐶𝑙.

In the first step of the Table II itself, the false data injection 
by 𝐶𝑙 is not captured by MIIM as the entity is fully operational 

otherwise. After evaluating the IDR also, this drawback of  𝐶𝑙 
is not reflected in the state value of 𝐶𝑖 which depends on the 
data from 𝐶𝑙. However, in MSIIM, all the entities getting data 
from 𝐶𝑙 will be having a state value of 1 and this will help the 
destination node or a PDC to trace back through the path of 
entities having a state value 1 and identify the entity injecting 
false data into the system. Yet, the challenge lies in detecting 
the false data injection by a particular node or ICT channel. In 
this paper, it is assumed that, a node injecting false data into 
the system cannot identify that but, all nodes receiving data 
from  that  compromised  node  can  identify  the  false  data 
injection  using  the  technique  described  in  section  IV  and 
thereby, they update the state value of the node in the previous 
hop to 1. Unlike MIIM IDRs which are evaluated by the CCs 
based  on  data  received  from  the  RTUs  and  PMUs,  each 
communication entity of the smart grid in MSIIM can evaluate 
their own IDR and send the state value to the CC. Moreover, 
IDRs  are  re-generated  for  only  the  communication  entities 
which are selected for sending data to the CC in that round of 
data routing. Therefore, the IDR for a C type entity consists of 
other  C  type entities  which  are  also  selected for  that round. 
Only the IDRs of P type entities are evaluated by the CCs. A 
distributed  state  table  is  maintained  in  MSIIM  where  each 
entity has the state values of all its connected entities. Each 
time  data  is  received  from  some  of  the  C  types  entities 
connected to it and data successfully sent to the next hop, the 
state  table  is  updated.  In  case  of  a  false  data  injection,  the 
compromised node will have a state value of 2 or 3 and all its 
neighboring C type entities getting data from it will have its 
state  value  as  1.  This  will  help  the  PDC  to  identify  the 
compromised node. Section IV illustrates this with the help of 
fig.3. 

IV.  ROUTING OF PMU DATA FROM SUBSTATIONS TO 
CONTROL CENTERS 

A.  Assumptions 

•  PMUs, CC-gateways and CC-servers are trusted.  

•  FDI attack can take place at any point after the data is 
sent by the PMUs and before it is received by the CC-
gateways. 

•  An  MSIIM  state 

is  maintained  by  each 
communication entity in the smart grid and whenever, 

table 

 
 
 
an  entity  gets  involved  in  the  routing  process,  it 
recalculates  its  own  state  value  based  on  the  state 
values of entities connected to it and the MSIIM IDRs. 

B.  Secure Routing Technique 

The  MSIIM  based  secure  routing  technique  for  a  smart 

grid system is divided into three modules as follows: 

1)  Module 1: Data forwarding to substation gateways by 

PMUs 

gateway 

The PMUs generate 48 time stamped samples of data per 
processing unit clock cycle from the analog signals received 
from the current and voltage sensors. The samples are sent to 
the 𝐺𝑊𝑖 in which the PMU is placed via a dedicated wireless 
communication channel. In this work, PMUs are considered 
trusted.  Data  from  the  PMUs  of  a  substation  are  stored  in 
separate  data  queues  by  the  𝐺𝑊𝑖.  The  MSIIM  IDR  for  a 
substation 
as: 
is 
𝐺𝑊𝑖 ←
[(𝑃𝑀𝑈1◉𝑃𝑀𝑈2◉ … 𝑃𝑀𝑈𝑛) ○ (𝑅1◉𝑅2 … 𝑅𝑚)] 
assuming 
there are n number of PMUs in the substation and m number 
of relay nodes at one-hop distance from the 𝐺𝑊𝑖. If the 𝐺𝑊𝑖 
receives  data  from  all  the  PMUs  of  that  substation  then  it 
works at state 3. If any one of the PMUs don’t operate, then 
its state changes to 2. Similarly, it should remain connected to 
all the relay nodes at one hop distance to get a state value 3. 
After calculating its own state value, the 𝐺𝑊𝑖 starts Module 2 
of the secure routing technique. 

given 

2)  Module 2: Data forwarding by substation gateways to 

PDCs 

The steps of module 2 is shown in the flowchart of fig.2. 
In this module, each gateway 𝐺𝑊𝑖 discovers all possible paths 
from  itself  to  the  PDC  of  that  region,  consisting  of  nodes 
having a state value ≥ 1. 𝐺𝑊𝑖 calculates the trust values of each 
path by forwarding a number of test messages through them. 
Trust value of the ith path is calculated as: 

𝑇𝑉𝑖

𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ 𝑖

= ∑

𝑗=1

𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 𝑗
𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑜 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 𝑗

    (1)

𝐺𝑊𝑖 then selects four paths with the highest 𝑇𝑉𝑖. Pair-wise 
keys are generated and exchanged between adjacent nodes in 
each path and also the MSIIM IDR of each node in a path is 
also generated as shown in fig.2. 𝐺𝑊𝑖 now generates a secret 
key 𝑆𝐾𝑖 and shares it with the PDC of that region : 

•  Four 

random  binary  numbers  of  equal  size─ 

𝑘1, 𝑘2, 𝑘3 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑘4 are generated by 𝐺𝑊𝑖. 

•  A  secret  key  (𝑆𝐾𝑖)  is  now  generated  by  𝐺𝑊𝑖    by 

XORing the four binary numbers: 

               𝑆𝐾𝑖 = 𝑘1 𝑋𝑂𝑅 𝑘2 𝑋𝑂𝑅 𝑘3 𝑋𝑂𝑅 𝑘4            (2) 

•  Now,  each  such  binary  number  𝑘𝑖  is  XORed  with  a 
binary number with equal number of 1s to generate a 
key fragment in the following way: 

o  Let, 𝑘𝑖 has a size 4: 𝑘𝑖 = 𝐵1𝐵2𝐵3𝐵4 where 

𝐵𝑖 is a binary digit. 

o  Key  Fragment  (𝐾𝐹𝑖)  is  generated  as: 

𝐾𝐹𝑖 = 𝑘𝑖 𝑋𝑂𝑅 1111 

•  Now, each of 4 key fragments is encrypted using RC5 
symmetric  cypher  and  the  pairwise  key  that  the 
gateway shares with each of the next of nodes in the 
four  most 
trusted  paths.  A  Hashed  Message 
Authentication  Code  (HMAC)  [2]  is  generated  over 
the total message using the same pairwise key. 

•  Each  node  in  the  trusted  path  matches  the  HMAC 
using the pairwise key it shares with its previous node 
in  the  path  and  if  match  is  found,  a  new  HMAC  is 
generated over the encrypted key fragment using the 
pairwise  key  of  the  next  node  and  this  process  is 
repeated  till  the  encrypted  key  fragment  reaches  the 
PDC.  

•  The PDC receives the four key fragments via the four 
trusted  paths  and  generates  the  secret  key  in  the 
following way: 

        𝑆𝐾𝑖 = 𝐾𝐹1 𝑋𝑂𝑅 𝐾𝐹2 𝑋𝑂𝑅 𝐾𝐹3 𝑋𝑂𝑅 𝐾𝐹4       (3) 
The Key Fragment sent via ith path is stored by each 
node in that path. Any attacker cannot get hold of the 
secret key even if it gets a Key Fragment. 

  The 𝐺𝑊𝑖 now uses this secret key to encrypt each part of 
the  data  from  PMU  using  RC5  symmetric  cypher  and  it 
generates  a  HMAC  using  the  same  secret  key  over  the 
encrypted data. 𝐺𝑊𝑖 now selects one of the four most trusted 
path  to  forward  the  encrypted  data.  A  nested  HMAC  is 
generated over the whole data using the 𝐾𝐹𝑖 sent through that 
path  and  another  nested  HMAC  is  generated  using  the 
pairwise key it shared with the next hop nodes in the trusted 
paths. The encrypted and MACed data is forwarded to the next 
hop in one of the selected trusted paths. 

  The format of the data fragment sent via the ith path is: 

𝐺𝑊𝑖
→ 𝑅𝑖: 𝐸𝐷𝐹||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶 (𝑃𝐾𝑖; 𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐾𝐹𝑖; 𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝑆𝐾𝑖; 𝐸𝐷𝐹))) 

where EDF is the encrypted data fragment. This process is 
repeated for all four parts of the 48 samples from a PMU and 
they  are  forwarded  to  the  PDC  using  the  four  most  trusted 
paths. The same paths are used by the 𝐺𝑊𝑖 to forward data to 
PDC until an FDI attack is detected in one of the paths.  The 
NHMAC  using  𝑃𝐾𝑖  helps  in  identifying  FDI  attacks  by  a 
compromised communication channel between two nodes; the 
NHMAC using 𝐾𝐹𝑖 helps in identifying the FDI attack by any 
compromised node and any unobservable attack can be finally 
detected by the PDC using the NHMAC over the encrypted 
data generated using the secret key 𝑆𝐾𝑖. 

Each  relay  node  𝑅𝑖  receiving  a  data  fragment  from  the 
previous node in the ith trusted path, first matches the HMAC 
generated using its own pairwise key with the previous hop 
node. If match is not found, it marks its own state value as 1. 
Now,  if  the  HMAC  generated  using  the  key  fragment  𝐾𝐹𝑖 
don’t match, it also marks state value of the previous node in 
the path as 1. It stops forwarding the data fragment and sends 
its own state value to the next node. The next node calculates 
its own state value using MSIIM IDR and forwards the same 
to  its  next hop,  and finally  it is  forwarded  to  the  PDC. The 
PDC now uses the state values of the nodes to trace the node 
injecting false data [Fig.3.]. 

 
Fig. 2.  Flowchart describing Module 2 of secure routing scheme 

paths  to  resend  that  data  fragment  to  PDC.    In  case  a  FDI 
attack  is  not  detected  by  the  relay  nodes  of  a  path  but  the 
NHMAC using the 𝑆𝐾𝑖 generated by the PDC does not match 
with the attached NHMAC, then the whole path is marked as 
unsafe.  

3)  Module  3:  Data  forwarding  by  PDCs  to  the  CC-

gateways 

Each  PDC  after  receiving  data  from  all  the  four  paths 
decrypt them using the secret key. PDC aggregates the data 
from  all  the  PMUs.  Each  of  the  CC-gateways  use  Elliptic 
Curve  Diffie-Helman  (ECDH)  [2]  key  exchange  scheme  to 
establish a shared secret key with the PDC. The 𝐺𝑊𝑖 uses this 
secret key to encrypt the aggregated data and it also generates 
a HMAC over the encrypted data using the same shared secret 
key and attach it with the aggregated. This data is now sent to 
the CC-gateways through the dedicated fiber optic cables. 

V.  SIMULATION RESULTS 

In order to analyze the performance of the proposed secure 
routing technique that relies on the MSIIM model, a smart grid 
system  of  IEEE  118-Bus  is  considered.  The  network 
simulation area has 8 regions, 5 PDCs, 200 EHRNs and 107 
substations. 𝑆61 with buses 𝑃68, 𝑃69 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑃116 is selected as the 
main CC and 𝑆16 having buses 𝑃17 and 𝑃30 is selected as the 
backup CC.

Fig. 3.  Identification of the false data injecting node by PDC 

In fig.3. (a), the trusted paths are: {𝑅1 → 𝑅4 → 𝑅7}, {𝑅3 →
𝑅7},  {𝑅6 → 𝑅10 → 𝑅12}  and  {𝑅6 → 𝑅9 → 𝑅11 → 𝑅12}.  In 
fig.3.  (b),  relay  node  𝑅9  is  compromised  and  it  is  injecting 
false data into the system, which is first noticed by 𝑅11 and it 
only forwards the state value to the next node 𝑅12 and it also 
calculates its own state value in fig.3. (c). 𝑅11 also changes the 
state value of 𝑅9 to 1, in its own state table. The compromised 
𝑅9 will still maintain a state value greater than 1 in its own 
state table. PDC1 checks the state value of 𝑅12 and it is 1 in 
both its own table and the state table of 𝑅12. PDC1 now checks 
to the next-hop nodes connected to 𝑅12. 𝑅10 has a state value 
3 and it is same in the state table of 𝑅12 as well. There that 
path is not checked any more. PDC1 finds the state value of 
𝑅11 and 𝑅9 as 1. When the state table of 𝑅9 is checked, PDC1 
finds  that  it  has  a  state  value  greater  than  1.  Now  𝑅9  is 
identified  as  the  node  injecting  false  data  and  the  PDC 
immediately sends the ID of 𝑅9 to both the CCs, so that 𝑅9 is 
removed from the list of nodes in the ICT network of the smart 
grid. The PDC also sends the ID of  𝑅9 and a NAK to  𝐺𝑊𝑖.

A.  Percentage of EHRN compromised vs. Communication 

delay 
In  fig.4,  the  communication  delay  vs.  the  percentage  of 
node  compromise  is  shown.  When  a  certain  number  of 
malicious  nodes  are  detected  in  the  network  region  and  the 
𝐺𝑊𝑖𝑠  have  to  rediscover  new  set  of  paths  to  the  PDC,  the 
communication  delay  increases.  Again,  when  a  number  of 
paths  are  discovered  and  stored,  increase  in  the  number  of 
malicious  nodes  only  result  in  discarding  of  compromised 
paths and selection of new paths from the stored list, resulting 
in a slight drop of the communication delay. It is also observed 
that even with 25% of node compromise, the communication 
delay is as low as 30.4 seconds.  

energy  consumed  by  each  active  EHRN  when  FDI  attack 
takes  place,  increases  as  the  number  of  fabricated  packets 
increase in the network. However, the consumption of energy 
is  very  nominal  for  resending  the  data  packets  that  are 
fabricated before. When there are 45 fabricated data packets 
in the network, the average energy consumed by each node is 
0.104 mAh.

packets dropped 

Fig. 5.  Number of compromised nodes vs. Percentage of packets dropped 

Fig.5.  shows  the  number  of  compromised  nodes  in  the 
network vs. the percentage of packets dropped. It is observed 
that  even  40  EHRNs  are  compromised,  the  packet  drop 
percentage is only 12.5%. Each gateway selects a portion of 
the  total  number  of  nodes  in  the  network  in  the  four  most 
trusted paths to PDCs and as a result most of the other nodes 
remain  idle.  If  such  idle  nodes  are  compromised,  the 
communication of PMU data to the CCs will not be harmed 
and  they will  not be  selected again. However,  if  an  already 
selected node is compromised, it will result in packet drop in 
the next hop only. Then the false data is not forwarded further, 
and the faulty node is removed. Therefore, the packet drop is 
not very high in the proposed routing technique.

consumed 
In fig.6, the average energy consumed by each active node 
vs. the  number of  fabricated packets  is  shown. The  average

VI.  CONCLUSION 

The  region  based  remote  monitoring  adopted  in  the 
proposed  routing technique not only involves lesser number 
of relay nodes in forwarding the PMU data to the PDCs but 
also it helps in easy identification of a compromised node in a 
particular area of the smart grid. The MSIIM model proposed 
in this paper helps  in  accurate  estimation of  the operational 
levels  of  the  entities  in  the  smart  grid.  Forwarding  of  data 
packets  to  an  ICT  entity  with  lower  operational  level  than 
required will result in increased packet drop and resending of 
packets. This model will also help the operators to examine a 
cyber-attack in the smart grid system before it actually takes 
place and know about the consequences. In the proposed work 
PMUs  are  considered  to  be  trusted.  Identifying  false  data 
injection by PMUs using the MSIIM model and thereby taking 
necessary actions can be a scope of future work.
