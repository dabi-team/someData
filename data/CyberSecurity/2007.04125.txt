Abstract 

The forensic investigation of cyber attacks and IT 
incidents  is  becoming  increasingly  difficult  due  to 
increasing  complexity  and 
intensify  networking. 
Especially  with  Advanced  Attacks  (AT)  like  the 
increasing  Advanced  Persistent  Threats  an  agile 
approach  is  indispensable.  Several  systems  are 
involved  in  an  attack  (multi-host  attacks).  Current 
forensic  models  and  procedures  show  considerable 
deficits in the process of analyzing such attacks. For 
this  purpose,  this  paper  presents  the  novel  flower 
model,  which  uses  agile  methods  and  forms  a  new 
forensic  management  approach.  In  this  way,  the 
growing  challenges  of  ATs  are  met.  In  the  forensic 
investigation of such attacks, big data problems have 
to be solved due to the amount of data that needs to 
be  analyzed.  The  proposed  model  meets 
this 
requirement  by  precisely  defining  the  questions  that 
need to be answered in an early state and collecting 
only the evidence usable in court proceedings that is 
needed  to  answer  these  questions.  Additionally,  the 
novel flower model for AT is presented that meets the 
different phases of an investigation process.  

1. Introduction 

In  the  last  year’s  industry,  governments  and 
institutions had to face more and more complex and 
enduring cyber-attacks, such as ThyssenKrupp [1] or 
RUAG  [2].  Mandiant  reported  attacks  on  a  wide 
spectrum  of  industries  in  2015  [3].  The  median 
number  of  days  a  threat  group  was  active  in  a 
network  before  detection  has  been  205  days  in  year 
2014,  where  the  longest  presence  was  2982  days. 
Such  advanced  attacks  (AT)  are 
long-running, 
complex  and  often  have  the  goal  to  steal  or  destroy 
data.  The  know-how  of  the  attackers  is  high  and 
therefore  the  attacks  are  highly  sophisticated  and 
heterogeneous.  Furthermore,  the  attack  tool  support 
the  attackers  are  getting  more  and  more 
for 
the  development  of 
professionalized,  whereas 
forensic software is second-order driven. 

2. Problem Description 

Digital  forensic  is  defined  as  analytical  and 
investigative  techniques  used  for  the  preservation, 
identification,  extraction,  documentation,  analysis, 

and  interpretation  of  computer  media  (e.g.  data  on 
SSD/HDD/DVDs,  log  data  on  host  systems  or  log 
data  for  network  activities).  When  it  comes  to  ATs 
the  amount  of  computer  media  that  has  to  be 
analyzed  in  a  forensic  process  is  increasing.  This  is 
partly  due  to  its  long  duration  and  persistence.  ATs 
have  a  higher  sophistication  level  as  basic  or 
moderate attacks and are more difficult to clarify. In 
particular through the cautious and covert approach, 
whereby  slow  progress  from  the  attack  side  is 
consciously accepted in order not to be discovered. 

that 

focus  on 

Forensic  investigations  of  ATs  therefore  need  to 
adapt  to  these  characteristics.  Classical  forensic 
approaches 
individual  systems 
(classical  post-mortem  forensic)  and  that  collect  all 
data in a first step and then try to extract hypotheses 
from  this  data  is  no  longer  expedient  (shotgun 
forensic  vs.  sniper  forensic  [4]).  This  is  because  on 
the one hand not only individual systems are affected 
but  also  the  communication  between  them  (network 
forensic).  On  the  other  hand  the  amount  of  data 
becomes  bigger  and  therefore  big  data  analysis 
approaches  are  required  that  define  questions  asked 
in  a  first  manner  and  then  select  the  data  that  can 
answer them. 

Therefore  a  forensic  approach  for  ATs  is  needed 
that is agile and takes network forensic as well as big 
data into account. Due to the complexity of ATs the 
new model also aims to fit the different steps a high 
sophisticated intruder makes during the attack. 

3. Related Work 

For  a  digital  forensic  model,  it  is  important  to 
guide  the  investigation  process  in  a  continuously 
transparent  way.  When  it  comes  to  ATs  the  model 
also needs to be flexible because of the heterogeneity 
of  ATs.  In  the  past,  several  forensic  models  have 
been presented. 

Du  et  al.  [5]  describe  three  phases  in  the  current 
evolution  of  digital  forensic  process  models.  From 
2000  to  2010  general  models  have  been  defined, 
such  as  McKemmish's  SAP  model  (secure,  analyze, 
and present) in [6] or more detailed ones such as the 
extended model of cyber-crime investigation [7] that 
enhances  the  model  of  Casey  [8]  that  provides  a 
scientific basis for the digital forensic process. These 
early frameworks have a linear procedure in common 
and they do not take ATs and big data problems into 
account. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  second  phase,  these  models  have  been 
refined and the newer approaches focus on particular 
steps  in  the  investigation  process.  In  [9]  Agarwal  et 
al.  present  a  model  that  focuses  on  computer  fraud 
and cybercrimes. None of them do treat ATs or focus 
on big data issues. 

The  third  mentioned  phase  in  [5]  describes  the 
recent  research  in  this  field.  New  technologies  are 
taken  into  account  such  as  cloud  computing  and 
internet  of  things  (IoT).  Some  research  has  been 
done when it comes to big data and forensic. In [10] 
a  framework  for  data  reduction  and  data  mining  is 
presented  that  is  not  suggested  to  replace  full 
analysis  but  serves  to  provide  a  rapid  triage.  They 
conclude  that  this  approach  is  time  consuming  but 
has its advantages in the field of topic browsing. 

All of the presented work are collecting data first 
and then try to reduce the amount of data  or extract 
the 
the  relevant  evidence 
questions  asked  in  a  first  step.  None  of  the  existing 
models  meets  the  requirements  for  an  agile  sniper 
forensic model. Although these aforesaid approaches 
can be used as guide in our new model.

4. Research Questions 

The forensic process faces many challenges when 
it comes to ATs. The characteristics of these kind of 
attacks  create  a  big  data  scenario  that  has  to  be 
addressed in research. The heterogeneity of ATs also 
has  to  be  taken  into  account  for  a  forensic  model. 
the  following  research  questions  are 
Therefore 
expected to be answered. 

1)  What  does  the  procedure  look  like  when  it 
comes  to  the  forensic  investigation  of  advanced 
attacks  having  regard  to  the  heterogeneity  of  the 
attacks?

5.  Agile  Sniper  Forensics  for  Advanced 
Attacks Approach 

The  novel  approach  focuses  on  the  forensic 
investigation  of  advanced  attacks  and  meets  the 
modern  challenges  of  an  agile  sniper  approach.  It 
consists  of  three  parts:  The  two  sub  processes 
Investigation and Documentation as well as the novel 
flower model. 

5.1 Flower Model 

The flower model illustrates the attack procedure 
presented  in  Figure  1  taking  Mandiant’s  attack 
lifecycle  [3]  and  Hutchins  et  al.  intrusion  kill  chain 
[11]  into  account.  The  model  separates  the  attack  in 
two  perspectives,  Attacker  and  Target.  This  is 
because from a forensic process’ point of view in the 
step  Initial  Information  Gathering  an  attacker  uses 
public available information and legitimate tools and 
therefore this is hard to detect and to prove as part of 
the  attack.  Nevertheless,  a  regularly  self-check  to 
delete sensible public data or generatable information 
higher the attack difficulty for an intruder and should 
be  part  of  the  restoration  process  after  the  forensic 
investigation. 

Figure 1 Flower Model for attack step 
illustration

successful 

The  initial  information  gathering  results  in  the 
initial  compromise  of  the  first  target  system.  Each 
compromised system during the attack is represented 
as  a  flower  (right  hand  side  of  the  figure)  with 
different steps as the flowers leaves. These represent 
the  other  phases  of  the  attack  such  as  escalating 
privileges 
compromise, 
maintaining  access  and  control  over  the  target 
through backdoors and the connection to a command 
and  control  server  (C2),  information  gathering  on 
the  host  and/or  network,  e.g.  through  several  scan 
techniques,  actions  on  objective  such  as  data 
tracks.  The  arrow 
exfiltration  and  covering 
compound  the  result  either  of  the  attacker’s  initial 
compromise or the action move from the perspective 
of  a  Target.  ADs  usually  include  multiple  systems 
that are compromised due to lateral movement steps. 
These steps are illustrated by the  move action in the 
Flower Model where the first compromised system’s 
(patient  zero)  Compromise  action  results  from  the 
initial  compromise  of  the  attacker.  The  model  also 
takes  into  account  that  there  can  be  more  than  one 
initial compromised system, which leads to multiple 
initial compromise actions, as well as more than one 
move action.  

The Target’s get connected to an attack graph that 
represents  the  involved  compromised  systems  and 
illustrates the attack chain.

5.2 Invesitgation and documentation method 

(IDM) 

The  digital  forensic  process  makes  use  of  the 
flower model to comprehend the AT. Figure 2 shows 
this agile sniper forensic approach. 

Figure 2. Agile Sniper Forensic Model 

It is divided into two sub processes, Investigation 
and  Documentation where these two processes exist 
simultaneously.  The  global  management  process 
starts with defining the general questions that need to 
be  answered  to  forensically  reproduce  the  AT.  For 
each  found  compromised  system,  the  questions 
related  to  it  are  defined  and  the  sub  processes  are 
done.  According  to  Greiner  [12]  examples  for  such 
questions are: 

  How did the attacker(s) get onto the 
system? 

  What did the attacker(s) do on the system 
and what did they steal? 

  How did the attacker(s) escape / move 
laterally? 

  How did the attacker(s) get the stolen data 
off the system? 

The 

Investigation 

sub  process 

starts  with 
collecting  the  data  that  is  needed  to  answer  the 
defined  questions.  These  data  can  be 
rough 
categorized  in  host,  network  and  misc.  Sources  of 
information are usually log files and temporary files 
as  well  as  status  information  like  timestamps,  user 
rights,  and  processes.  When  it  comes  to  AT  the 
amount  of  data  that  needs  to  be  analyzed  is  big. 
Therefore in our approach these data sources that are 
relevant to the defined questions  need to be defined 
and  only  that  data  is  collected.  This  subset  of  data 
than  is  filtered  to  get  the  specific  data  for  the 
separate questions. It is examined so hypotheses can 
be developed that answer the defined questions.  The 
results are then checked with the found data.  

In  parallel 

the  Documentation  sub  process 
documents the investigation steps. The questions for 
extracting  the  necessary  data  as  well  as  the  steps  to 
collect  it  are  recorded.  Therefore  an  official  and 
common  agreed  process  is  mandatory,  which  is 
integrity  securing.  The  collected  data  is  stored  with 

checksums  and  signatures  in  a  matter  that  its 
integrity  is  provable.  During  the  examination  in  the 
Investigation  process  the  developed  hypotheses  also 
need to be documented. The last step is the reporting 
of the audit actions to verify the hypotheses.  

If  more  data  is  needed  to  answer  the  questions, 
other  filters  need  to  be  applied,  hypotheses  are 
refuted,  or  new  hypotheses  are  developed  that  need 
to  be  proven,  these  sub  processes  will  be  repeated 
until the answers to the questions are proven with the 
data. 

The whole process is also repeated until the initial 
attack  vector  for  the  compromised  system  is  found 
and  its  origin  (system  or  attacker)  is  found.  The 
model  is  designed  to  adapt  the  questions  depending 
on  the  found  evidence  on  a  system.  This  is  to  be 
agile  on  the  steps  taken  by  the  attacker.  Each 
compromised  system  is  treated  this  way  during  the 
digital  forensic  investigation.  The  documentation 
builds  the  separate  flowers  from  the  flower  model 
with  its  leaves  and  connects  them  so  the  complete 
attack is forensically reproducible in the report. 

6. Evaluation 

We  analysed  21  technical  reports  on  ADs  ([2], 
[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], 
[23],  [24],  [25],  [26],  [27],  [28],  [29],  [30],  [31], 
[32]).  These  reports  analysed  one  or  more  attacks 
that  used  similar  types  of  malwares  and  tools  per 
report. To show that an agile approach is needed we 
examined the amount of targets involved in  such an 
attack and the steps taken by the attackers. 

The  reports  show  that  in  all  21  cases  multiple 
targets  were  part  of  the  attacks.  The  six  types  of 
actions on a target – the leaves of the flower model – 
were  also  present  on  the  analysed  reports.  The 
actions  and  tools  used  by  the  attackers  were 
heterogeneous  and  targeted  on  their  objectives. 
Therefore  the  forensic  analysis  process  needs  to  be 
agile  to  the  attack.  The  presented  approach  will  be 
evaluated  in  more  detail  in  a  practical  manner  in 
future work. 

7. Conclusion and Next Steps 

In  this  proposal,  the  need  for  a  digital  forensic 
management  approach  for  advanced  attacks  was 
pointed  out.  With  the  agile  sniper  forensic  model 
processes were presented as a first step towards such 
a  management  approach.  For 
the  ease  of 
reproducibility also the flower model was introduced 
that can be used for documentation purposes. 

In the next steps, this forensic approach has to be 
refined and tested in a practical manner. Therefore a 
specific tool support will be developed. It also has to 
be analyzed what techniques can be used to identify 
and  extract  relevant  data  and  also  where  to  place 
sensors to capture the relevant data.
