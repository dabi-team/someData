Co-Design of Watermarking and Robust Control
for Security in Cyber-Physical Systems

Raman Goyal, Christoforos Somarakis, Erfaun Noorani and Shantanu Rane

Abstract— This work discusses a novel framework for
simultaneous synthesis of optimal watermarking signal and
robust controllers in cyber-physical systems to minimize
the loss in performance due to added watermarking
signal and to maximize the detection rate of the attack.
A general dynamic controller is designed to improve
system performance with respect to the H2 norm, while
a watermarking signal
is added to improve security
performance concerning the detection rate of replay
attacks. The attack model considered in the paper is a
replay attack, a natural attack mode when the dynamics
of the system is unknown to the attacker. The paper ﬁrst
generalizes the existing result on the detection rate of χ2
detector from a static-LQR controller to a general dynamic
controller. The design improvements on both robustness
and security fronts are obtained by iteratively solving
the convex subsets of the formulated non-convex problem
in terms of
the controller and watermarking signal.
A semi-deﬁnite programming optimization is formulated
using Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) results to solve
the larger system-level design optimization problem. We
highlight the effectiveness of our method over a simpliﬁed
three-tank chemical system.

I. INTRODUCTION

these technologies

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things
(IoT) devices have become an essential part of today’s
critical infrastructures, ﬁnancial markets, governments,
as well as our daily lives. The inherent vulnerability
of
to unauthorized use, digital
theft, or other malicious attacks declared the area
of Cyber-Security of vital importance in our modern
way of living. This importance has been magniﬁed
by the proliferation of notorious malicious actors
and high-proﬁle Cyber-Attacks, especially in industrial
control systems [1]. The security of these systems has
attracted the interest of several research communities
with the activity that continues into the third decade
[2]–[4]. In the control community,
the efforts have
focused on fast and efﬁcient methods of detection
and isolation of misbehaviors [5], [6]. One particular

problem of great interest is the design of watermarking
signals in detecting malicious attacks [7]. This is a
method of data authentication that infuses nominal data
with untraceable and unrepeatable signals,
typically
noise, and has proven to be very effective against system
attacks with the aid of observation replays. In these
attacks, the attacker records the output signal for some
amount of time and then replays it while attacking the
system e.g. recording and replaying security videos [8].
This way the system user would remain oblivious to
ongoing attacks, without discrepancy between the replay
signals and an appropriately designed watermark that
triggers a detection mechanism.

as

However, watermarking is typically fed into the
plant
extra noise, degrading the performance
of the system. Within a standard system dynamics
framework, it can be shown that the more effective the
watermarking, the stronger the performance degradation.
The obvious potential consequences on the actual
(typically nonlinear) dynamics, a degradation of the
linearized system can cast upon, motivates our interest
to look into the problem of the simultaneous design
of watermarking architectures and robust controllers
against replay attacks. Similar ideas of simultaneous
design of controller and sensor/actuator placement
the
have been considered in the literature to get
optimal desired performance. Most of
the existing
literature focuses on the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian
(LQG) controllers. We treat
the LQG problem as
a special case of the larger class of H2 problems
[9] and consider a synthesis of H2 robust controller
for an LTI system to improve system volatility to
random disturbances while at
the same time we
infuse a watermarking signal of similar random nature.
It appears that
these two system components are
fundamentally competitive, while a straightforward
coupling for optimal synthesis yields a non-convex
optimization problem. To this end, we propose a design
method, that although sub-optimal, provides a signiﬁcant
improvement on the overall robustness and detection
rate security performance. For the H2 control synthesis
problem works most relevant to this paper are [10], [11].
The literature on the design of watermarking signals

 
 
 
 
 
 
for system security, of relevance to this paper, is vast.
Due to space limitation, we refer the interested reader
to [12]–[15], and cited works therein.

The contributions and the organization of the paper
can be laid out as follows: Section §II formulates
the problem, details the attack model, and discusses
the watermarking signal characteristics. Section §III
elaborates the system design approach by considering
the design of the most general dynamic controller as a
convex function of the watermarking signal. We further
synthesize the Kalman ﬁlter in the LMI framework as a
convex function of the watermarking signal and ﬁnally,
generalize the existing result on the detection rate of
χ2 detector with a general dynamic controller which
was restricted to LQR static feedback controller [16].
Section §IV formulates the big non-convex optimization
problem and then provides a solution by breaking
down the problem into small convex subsets, iterations
over which result in a locally optimal solution to the
original non-convex problem. Sections §V and §VI
give a detailed numerical example and ﬁnal concluding
remarks along with the future work.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

A. System Description

Let us consider a discrete-time linear time-invariant
(LTI) system described by the following state-space
representation:

xk+1 = Axk + Buk + Dwk,

(1)

yk = Cxk + vk,

(2)
where xk ∈ Rnx is the state of the system at time k,
uk ∈ Rnu is the control vector at time k. The initial
state vector x0 and the process noise at time k, wk,
are assumed to be independent random variables. In
particular, wk ∼ N (0, W ), ∀k, with W ∈ Rnw×nw to
be known and ﬁxed covariance matrix. The output of the
system yk ∈ Rny , is measured by a sensor network with
noise modeled as another independent Gaussian random
variable vk ∼ N (0, V ), ∀k with V ∈ Rnv×nv to be
known and ﬁxed covariance matrix. The goal here is
to design a control law to achieve the desired system
performance.

B. Attack Model

This section models the malicious activity that can
be performed by the attacker to harm the control system
described in the previous section, see ﬁgure 1. An attack
model known as the replay attack is considered where
the attacker has the following capabilities:

1) The attacker has access to and can record all the

real-time sensor measurements for some time.

2) The attacker can replay the previously recorded
k = yk ⇐⇒ yk−τ while attacking with a sequence

data y(cid:48)
of malicious control input ua

k ∈ Rnua .

C. Optimal Watermarking Signal

The main idea of a physical watermark is to inject
a random noise (watermark signal)
through some
channels to excite the system and check whether the
system responds to the watermark signal in accordance
with the system dynamics. This section describes a
novel watermarking scheme where the intensity and
the channels through which watermarking signals are
injected are optimized with the simultaneous design of
the controller to achieve the desired system performance.
In the literature, the watermarking signals are added
to the existing actual control signal which is already
designed for some desired system performance. This
work simultaneously designs the control law uk and
watermarking signal ∆uk. The state dynamics of the
system in the presence of watermarking signal can be
written as:

xk+1 = Axk + Buk + B∆uk + Dwk,

yk = Cxk + vk,

(3)

(4)

which assumes that
the watermarking signal enters
through the control input channels. Let us model the
watermarking signal ∆uk as IID Gaussian random
variable with zero mean and covariance U > O, i.e.
∆uk ∼ N (0, U ), ∀k. Let us also deﬁne the inverse of
covariance of the watermarking signal as:

Γ (cid:44) U −1,

(5)

and now, one of the goals of this research work is to
ﬁnd the optimization variable Γ denoting the strength
of the watermarking signal which can also specify the
channels through which the signal should be added.

performance and detect the attack on the system. The
control objective is to design a dynamic compensator
of the form (6)-(7) below and simultaneously ﬁnd the
optimum watermarking signal to obtain a given level of
detection in the system and also bound the H2 norm
of the system output, i.e., (cid:107)y(cid:107)H2 ≤ ¯yH2 or bound the
covariance of output, i.e., E∞(yyT ) < ¯Y for given ¯Y
and ¯yH2 .

It is straightforward to show that the output covariance
can be bounded as:

which can be written as:

Let us assume the dynamic controller of the form:

k+1 = Ac xc

uk := Cc xc

k + Bc yk,
k + Dc yk.

(6)

(7)

A standard result in the literature requires the direct
feedforward term in the dynamic controller to be zero
for the bounded control
thus, we
will assume Dc = O for the rest of the analysis1.
Using the above compensator, the closed-loop system
dynamics can be written using the augmented state
xcT (cid:3) with augmented process noise
vector xT := (cid:2)xT

wT := (cid:2)∆uT wT

Notice that the constraint in Eqn. (14) is not an LMI. We
need to perform congruence transformation and change

deﬁne and partition the matrix as:

and wk ∼ N (0, W), where W := Diag{U, W, V }. It
is a standard result that the above closed loop system is
stable and a steady-state state covariance matrix (X > 0)
exists, if:

AXAT + BWBT < X,

(12)

which again can be written as:

X − AXX−1XT AT − BWBT > O.

(13)

Applying Schur’s complement on (13) gives:

respectively. Then applying {T , ˜T } to Eqn. (14) and
Eqn. (17), we obtain:

(14)

Expansion of (18) and (19) under an appropriate change
of variables leads to a set of LMIs that do not depend
on S or P . Once the X, Y are obtained, matrices S and
P need to be constructed using:

where (·)T represents the corresponding transpose of
the symmetric block and W is the covariance matrix

Y X + SP = I.

(20)

1Notation “O” (“I”) is used for zero (unit) matrix of appropriate

dimensions.

Notice that when the controller has the same order as the
plant, S and P are square and non-singular matrices, in

as:

Also, notice that the change of variables operator is

Another constraint to consider for a feasible controller
input

is to have a ﬁnite bou2nd on the control
covariance:

E∞(ukuT

(22)

which uses the earlier mentioned condition: Dc = O.

B. Estimator Design for Fault Detection

We will use the standard Kalman ﬁlter to estimate the
system states and the widely known χ2 detector for fault
detection in the closed-loop control system [19]. The

Kalman ﬁlter estimate, ˆx =

(cid:21)

(23)

which can be written using Schur’s complement as:

(28)

The above equation allows us to write the synthesis of
the Kalman ﬁlter in the LMI framework as a convex
function of optimization variable Γ which denotes the
strength of the watermarking signal.

where L is the Kalman gain given as:

where X is the steady-state state covariance matrix that
satisﬁes

where ˜A = A − KC, V = DWDT , K = S(V )−1, and
S = BWDT . After substituting for the system matrices
(Eqns. (8)-(9)), we get:
X = ˜AX ˜AT +B ˜WBT − ˜AXCT (cid:0)CXCT + V (cid:1)−1 CX ˜AT ,

the deﬁnition of gain matrix L from Eqn. 24, Eqn. 25
can be written as:

Let us partition the steady-state state covariance

matrix X as:

X (cid:44)

(cid:35)

(29)

The χ2 detector for fault detection is based on the
following lemma [19]:

follows

X = CX eC T + V,

where X e is the block sub-matrix of X from Eq.(29).
In view of the above result, the χ2 detector takes the
following form at time k :

X = ( ˜A − LC)X( ˜A − LC)T + B ˜WBT + LV LT .

subject to hypothesis testing

With the aim of minimizing trace(X), we use
Comparison Lemma [17] to write:
X − ( ˜A − LC)X( ˜A − LC)T − LV LT − B ˜WBT > O,

where T is the window size of detection and η is the
threshold that is related to the false alarm rate. When

the system is under normal operation, the left of the
above equation is χ2 distributed with mT degrees of
freedom. Furthermore, H0 denotes the system is under
normal operation while H1 denotes a triggered alarm.
Here, deﬁne the probability of false alarm αk and the
probability of detection rate βk as:

αk (cid:44) P (gk > η | H0) , βk (cid:44) P (gk > η | H1) . (30)

The following result highlights the impact of detector
gk during attack and non-attack events, in the presence
of a watermarking signal.

This subsection details the calculation of the detection
rate for an already designed closed-loop system with

Proof: Please see the appendix for the proof.

Remark 3.1: Please notice in the proof that

there
were some traces of residual dynamics due to the
dynamic controller which vanished asymptotically, to
give the same steady-state expression of the detection
rate as given in [16]. Hence, although the approach
and the expressions turned out identical, this new result
generalizes it to dynamic controllers.

Finally,

the main idea behind the detector is that
the detection
the replay attack deviations will avert
rate from converging to the false alarm rate due to
the statistical independence of watermarking signals as
given in Eqn. (33).

observe that the nonlinear maximization in detection rate

The joint design of watermarking signal and H2

The above mentioned problem is nonconvex in U/Γ

we consider a chemical process shown in Figure 2
linearized along the lines of [20]. The three states
x = (x1, x2, x3)T describe the level of water in tanks
2 and 3 and the temperature of water in tank 2. The
control inputs are two ﬂow pumps, one valve, and one
heater, as illustrated in Figure 2. The process noise
and measurement noise is assumed to be zero-mean
Gaussian with covariance W =10−3 I and V =10−3 I,
respectively. The linearized dynamics of this three-tank

Table I gives

the watermarking signal U and
the detection rate (i.e. trace (cid:0)C T X −1CU(cid:1)) for three
different cases mentioned in §IV.A, IV.B and IV.C.
Notice that the simulation results are designed to match
the H2 of the output for all
the three cases while

to approximately solve using iterative approaches. A
follow-up work would be to simultaneously design the
sensor and watermarking architecture to minimize the
loss in performance due to added watermarking signal
and still increase the detection rate of the attack.

Proof for Theorem 3.1: Let us assume y(cid:48)

k as the

output of the following virtual system [16]:

x(cid:48)
k+1 = Ax(cid:48)
k = Cx(cid:48)
y(cid:48)
k+1|k = Aˆx(cid:48)
ˆx(cid:48)

Basically,

to do a replay attack, we assume that
the attacker runs the virtual system and records the
sequence yk from time t. Then the virtual system is
just a time shifted version of the real system, with
k = xt+k, ˆx(cid:48)
x(cid:48)
Now we rewrite the estimation of the Kalman ﬁlter
ˆxk|k−1 in the following recursive way to be able to
detect the attack using the χ2 detector:

k|k = ˆxt+k|t+k.

ˆxk+1|k = Aˆxk|k + Buk + B∆uk
= Aˆxk|k + BCcxc
= A (cid:2)ˆxk|k−1 + L (cid:0)y(cid:48)
+ BCc(Acxc

k + B∆uk,

k) + B∆uk,

= A(I − LC)ˆxk|k−1 + BCcAcxc

+ (BCcBc − AL)y(cid:48)

k−1
k + B∆uk.

It can be easily shown that the same equation holds

true for the virtual system ˆx(cid:48)

k|k−1 :

k+1|k = A(I − LC)ˆx(cid:48)
ˆx(cid:48)

k|k−1 + BCcAcx(cid:48),c
k−1
k + B∆u(cid:48)
k.

+ (BCcBc − AL)y(cid:48)

Subtracting the above two equations, deﬁne A (cid:44) A(I −
LC), B (cid:44) BCcAc, to get:

ˆxk+1|k − ˆx(cid:48)

k+1|k = A

which can also be written for ˆxk|k−1 − ˆx(cid:48)

Notice that y(cid:48)

k|k−1 follows exactly the same
distribution as yk − C ˆxk|k−1. Hence, if A is stable, the
second term will converge to 0 and if A and Ac are
both stable, the third term will converge to 0. Thus, y(cid:48)
k −
C ˆxk|k−1 will converge to the same distribution as yk −
C ˆxk|k−1 if there is no watermarking signal added to the
system, hence, the detection rate for χ2 detector will be
the same as false alarm rate, making the detector useless.
Now notice that ∆ui is independent of the virtual

Finally, the expectation of χ2 detector gk is written as:
