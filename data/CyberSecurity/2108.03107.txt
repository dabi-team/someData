Abstract. As users increasingly introduce Internet-connected devices
into their homes, having access to accurate and relevant cyber secu-
rity information is a fundamental means of ensuring safe use. Given the
paucity of information provided with many devices at the time of pur-
chase, this paper engages in a critical study of the type of advice that
home Internet of Things (IoT) or smart device users might be presented
with on the Internet to inform their cyber security practices. We base
our research on an analysis of 427 web pages from 234 organisations that
present information on security threats and relevant cyber security ad-
vice. The results show that users searching online for information are
subject to an enormous range of advice and news from various sources
with diﬀering levels of credibility and relevance. With no clear explana-
tion of how a user may assess the threats as they are pertinent to them, it
becomes diﬃcult to understand which pieces of advice would be the most
eﬀective in their situation. Recommendations are made to improve the
clarity, consistency and availability of guidance from recognised sources
to improve user access and understanding.

Introduction

Home Internet of Things (IoT) devices1 create diﬀerent risks to their users than
more traditional Internet-connected devices, such as personal computers. At an
individual level, these include threats to physical safety, home security, personal
control and privacy [20], and at a societal level, facilitating botnets and other
Internet-based crime [1]. As these devices may come with little in-built security,
these risks can quite quickly spread further than the individual device; as such

(cid:63) This is the author version of the article: Turner S., Nurse J., Li S. (2021) When
Googling It Doesn’t Work: The Challenge of Finding Security Advice for Smart

the user must also understand how to manage the appropriate security of their
entire home network. Home IoT devices are typically marketed on their min-
imal interfaces [9], leaving the user to search elsewhere for guidance on issues
such as cyber security. The availability of good quality, consistent and actionable
information is crucial for keeping users safe and conﬁdent in their device use.
Appropriately targeted levels of guidance for users is particularly necessary as
cyber security is broadly considered a diﬃcult topic for individuals to manage,
despite there being a general acceptance of individual accountability for per-
sonal device use [17]. This is increasingly important for users, manufacturers,
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and policy-making bodies to understand and
attempt to mitigate as sales in home IoT devices continue to grow apace, with
users seemingly undeterred by frequent media stories of data breaches and other
security risks.

This paper provides a review of cyber security information available on the
Internet in relation to home IoT devices. It is driven by three primary research
questions: what information is made available about cyber security threats posed
to individuals using home IoT devices, what information is given around how
to mitigate those threats, and what type of organisations or entities provide
that information. Using search methods that a typical user might undertake,
we ﬁnd that that advice that users are presented with is typically generalised
and not suﬃciently speciﬁc to act upon immediately, that the advice returned
is often contradictory between sources, and that organisations that users would
reasonably expect to have most responsibility for providing accurate content
(manufacturers, governmental bodies, and ISPs) are not as prominently featured
as they should be.

Following a brief literature review in Section 2, and methodology in Section 3,
we report our ﬁndings in Section 4. Section 5 considers the ways in which advice
may need to be better tailored and managed to bolster users’ understanding and
willingness to act. Section 6 considers limitations of the research, and how this
could be addressed with future work. Section 7 concludes the paper.

2 Literature Review

Previous research has looked at how users understand, evaluate and use cy-
ber security methods. Cost, eﬀort to set up and perceived ineﬃcacy have been
shown to stop individuals from adopting security tools such as anti-malware or
password managers [4]. Tabassum et al. [19] found that some home IoT device
owners applied security knowledge learned from other contexts (such as from
using computers and the Internet) when securing their home devices, despite
the diﬀerences in threats posed and potential mitigating actions required. It is
widely recognised that this action, in part, arises from a wide-spread lack of
accurate mental models about these devices [24], unless the user is already very
technically minded [12].

Even if individuals do act to implement cyber security measures at home,
they could be overwhelmed with the number of actions that are deemed to be

essential: Redmiles et al. [15] found 374 pieces of actionable advice in reviewing
publicly available documentation, and argued that what is needed is eﬀective
prioritisation of that advice. Prior to purchase, users rarely look for security and
privacy information, but note that it is impossible to ﬁnd if they do [7]. Gcaza
argued that security awareness is a necessary requirement for communities to
consider themselves “smart” [8]: enhanced levels of clarity have been called for
in both governmental and manufacturer’s advice, to promote tangible steps to
security [18], a better understanding of how the technology works [23], and how
the user is aﬀected in the case of a breach [25]. This clarity should extend to the
practices of the manufacturer, in particular in relation to privacy and security
concerns [11]. There is a clear beneﬁt to this: users will pay a premium for devices
that have prominent details about security features [2].

3 Methodology

In order to understand what a home IoT device user might encounter when
searching for information about how to secure devices that they may have, the
decision was taken to search the Internet for cyber security guidance. This was
done both in relation to general devices, using general search terms and reviewing
the results that mentioned home IoT devices speciﬁcally, as well as for the most
popular devices in the UK at this time: smart TVs (and streaming devices), and
smart home assistants [21]. This decision was made because of the proportion
of individuals voluntarily using these devices; ﬁndings for these speciﬁc types of
devices may oﬀer more value by virtue of their ubiquity than other device types.
Recent research has used similar practices in relation to posted user reviews [13]
to understand what type of information users may encounter online on speciﬁc
topics.

The general device resources were sought through search terms listed in Ta-
ble 1, and reﬂect a ﬁnal list after researcher experimentation with various similar
terms. Using these general search terms, pages in the results that had references
to home IoT devices were captured for analysis. Search terms relating to speciﬁc

devices took the form “How to secure my smart TV/streaming device/smart
speaker” along with “[manufacturer name] [device name] security” (e.g., “Ama-
zon Echo security”). Speciﬁc brands were chosen based upon lists of “Top devices
for 2020” focused on UK consumers.2 Having logged out of all browser accounts,
cleared user history and using a VPN connection to a diﬀerent IP address in
the UK, the search terms were entered into three search engines: Google, Bing
and Duck Duck Go,3 and non-paid search results from the ﬁrst two pages of
each search query were captured, on the understanding that less than one in ten
users are likely to go to the second page of search results [14]. The pages were
retrieved between August and December 2020. For both results from the gen-
eralised search and speciﬁc devices searches, each page was then reviewed, and
those that had content referring to home IoT devices were then taken forward
for analysis. Following methodology from [1] and [22], a number of predeﬁned
criteria were captured from each page, including who produced the information
and when, the type of devices considered, and the threats and advice given.

4 Results

4.1 Sources of information

The prominence of news and opinion outlets is clear in the results. 125 sources
(53.41%) of the 234 organisations with web pages considered in the review were
either recognised news organisations (such as The Guardian, Wired, CNet) or
websites oﬀering news and opinion pieces of varying levels of specialty and ex-
pertise, ranging from personal blogs to user-facing technology sites (such as PC
Mag, ZD Net). The search also returned a volunteer-run cyber security helpline,4
oﬀering help across a wide range of cyber security issues. We also found that the
favourable rankings of more traditional news sites acted to suppress sources of
advice and information about device security in favour of prior security and data
breaches: notably, a 2014 breach relating to Philips’ smart TV range still domi-
nated the ﬁrst two pages of results, even in Google’s Featured Snippets,5 despite
the age of the story. Although the majority of individual web pages returned
were dated 2019 and 2020 (228 web pages, 53.40%, of 427 total web pages), 91
were undated, and 2 websites (from a retailer, and anti-malware provider) had
content dating from 2011 (from the date given in the body of the article).

Only nine information sources of the 234 organisations were aﬃliated with
global governmental departments; there were three consumer protection bodies
(such as Which? and Consumer Reports) and ﬁve additional not-for-proﬁt or

charitable bodies. Conversely, bodies that may have been trying to sell a ser-
vice related to security were much more common: there were nine anti-malware
providers (such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky), and ﬁrms oﬀering cyber secu-
rity services (such as BullGuard, Digital Guardian and Cytelligence) accounted
for 21 pages. There were 13 forum sites, both third-party (Reddit, Stack Ex-
change) and manufacturer community pages. There were no sites from ISPs
returned in the results.

4.2 Reported threats

Discussions about cyber security typically arise from the need to secure some-
thing from a speciﬁc and meaningful threat. In the review, 57 individual types
of threats were raised; for the top ﬁve, see Table 2a. 144 websites referred to
some form of unauthorised access to devices, most typically “hacking”, without
further explanation (Table 3, #1). 39 web pages focused on either how to man-
age after you have been hacked or avoiding being hacked, typically presenting
reactive advice rather than explaining why it may be necessary to take proactive
measures ahead of an event (Table 3, #2). Malware and ransomware were men-
tioned a total of 30 times, with theft of personal data being mentioned 13 times.
Botnets were referenced nine times. It is noticeable how many types of threat
were referenced only once or twice throughout the review. 26 types of threat
came up only once (examples ranging from domestic abuse, to ghostware and
hacktivism). Lack of personal knowledge was framed as a threat (rather than a
potential vulnerability) in ﬁve instances (Table 3, #3). In some cases, the publi-
cation of speciﬁc academic or industry reports were reﬂected in the reporting of
several news sources (Table 3, #4). In these cases, the threats reported upon are
typically accompanied by the researchers’ views on how to mitigate the risk, al-
beit at a high level, often without accompanying links to manufacturer guidance
for speciﬁc devices.

4.3 Types of advice needed and provided

In total, there were 1,342 pieces of advice counted in the reviewed web pages,
which, when coded for advice type provided a total of 54 unique topics. The top
ﬁve advice types are listed in Table 2b.

S. Turner et al.

There were 149 separate instances of recommended strong password man-
agement (11.10% of the total pieces advice given), many of which gave advice
contrary to the current guidance from the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC) to use three random words to create a strong password. For example,
two manufacturers explicitly suggested that words found in the dictionary should
not be used (Table 3, #5), and suggestions to change passwords frequently were
also common (Table 3, #6).

Limiting the access services have to personal data was the second most fre-
quent type of advice given in the reviewed web pages (145 instances; 10.80%),
although precise guidance as to what this means for speciﬁc devices was not
generally explained. Disabling some features (such as Universal Plug and Play)
or turning oﬀ the device (or router, or WiFi) altogether was the fourth most
common (117; 8.71%). The trade-oﬀs of doing these actions were again, largely
unexplored (Table 3, #7). Speciﬁcity of advice was a common problem — the
heterogeneity of devices left some pages assuming that devices had particular
functionality as the premise of their advice (Table 3, #8), or providing a list of
things to do with no guidance at all (Table 3, #9). Other pages gave so much
advice as to run the risk of seeming overwhelming (Table 3, #10).

There were 143 instances of advice around improving the strength of home
networks. Advice around improving the strength of the user’s home network is
particularly diﬃcult to follow, as the exact, typically relatively technical, steps
vary upon the router in the house. In the general searches returned, there was no
guidance about smart home security provided by ISPs. Without further searching
in relation to the router owned by the individual, at ﬁrst glance it is impossible
for the reader to know which pieces of advice (such as “use a VPN” or “set up
a guest network”) would be feasible for their current router. Setting up a guest
network, in particular, was recommended, but the speciﬁcs of doing so were
varied: some pages suggested putting all the user’s devices on one network and
anyone external on the other (Table 3, #11); others suggested keeping home IoT
devices on one network, and the users’ other devices and guests on the second
(Table 3, #12); and there was also suggestion to keep your personal non-IoT
devices on one, and your home IoT devices and guests on the other (Table 3,
#13).

When manufacturer’s pages were returned in the reviewed web pages they
were typically in a wiki-format, for a very speciﬁc topic — focusing how to
change a speciﬁc setting rather than why you might do this — with minimal
visual guidance: a checklist of steps to perform a speciﬁc activity on a speciﬁc
device (Table 3, #14). In contrast, sites not aﬃliated with manufacturers oﬀer
more generic advice. Not only did they provide little to speciﬁc device guidance or
explanation as to what that would protect against, but they frequently suggested
additional products that come at additional costs. Some are explicit: buying a
more secure router (Table 3, #15), or, less clearly, products and services that can
come with a cost, such as anti-malware, VPNs or password managers (Table 3,
#16, #17). Other advice given includes to be choosy with home IoT device
providers (even at a risk of becoming locked into a single provider) (Table 3,

Finding Security Advice for Smart Home Devices

#18), and performing pre-purchase checks such as reading privacy and data
sharing/selling policies (Table 3, #19).

There was a striking lack of information about end of life device manage-
ment, with the exception of the negative press relating to Sonos’ decision to
stop supporting older models in early 2020 (Table 3, #20), and general advice
to “update software” (but not explicitly to be aware of the end of the supported
life of your device) (Table 3, #21). Only the NCSC discussed wiping a device at
the point of reselling or throwing away (Table 3, #22).

5 Discussion

A signiﬁcant proportion of the guidance discovered in the reviewed web pages was
not actionable for home IoT devices without further understanding or learning
by the reader. The heterogeneity of home IoT devices, and the situations in which
they are used, means that there there may be best practices that are speciﬁc to
the device and its use. Diﬀerent designs mean that users cannot guarantee that
they will be able to follow steps to disable settings, for example, to adhere to best
security practices, assuming the speciﬁc device they have has the functionality
to allow the user to access and alter security settings. Diﬀerent threats mean
that some users may be best oﬀ following diﬀerent advice for the same device,
but without an ability to accurately assess the threats and risks that the device
poses to them, users are likely to fall back to behaviours that have worked for
them before, which may not be appropriate in this case [19].

Furthermore, the most appropriate point to modify security settings may
be at the home network, and not device, level. Calls to alter router settings,
for example, are assuming that users have the technical conﬁdence, suﬃcient
access to the controls within the home setting, and that their routers have the
functionality to do so, none of which may be the case [24]. Additional suggestions
to use more software — ideally, purchase software — is problematic: it introduces
another barrier to eﬀective cyber security for those who cannot aﬀord it, and it
is unclear how to apply such software across all devices in the home, if it is even
possible to do so. The attrition rates for use of such software is likely to be high,
particularly if its value in protecting devices is not visible or obvious [4].

Governmental and consumer awareness resources did appear, often low down
in results. Despite their relative trustworthiness and validity as relevant and
impartial cyber security information, such resources are often indistinguishable
from other sources in search results. These other sources may have ﬁnancial
interests in the framing of their advice (such as anti-malware providers), or the
guidance may be from irrelevant or out of date sources. Users would beneﬁt
from higher placement in search results of oﬃcial guidance from governmental
agencies and manufacturers to try and provide up to date, speciﬁc information;
inspiration could be taken from the work done to place prominent information
from recognised expert bodies at the top of search results relating to COVID-19.
Advice to choose devices based upon more agreeable privacy policies or calls
to do research before purchase and buy “more secure devices” highlight a lack

10

S. Turner et al.

of congruence between the advice and real life. Privacy policies are notoriously
hard to read and comprehend [16], and oﬀer no ability for the user to negotiate
the terms of their use. Calling upon users to research devices prior to purchase
suggests that suﬃcient information is available to make a useful comparison of
security features — not only is it hard to ﬁnd this information, it may not be
meaningful or useful when found [7].

Providing standardised labels on packaging to provide information on fun-
damental security features may be helpful to help users determine what is im-
portant to them at the time of purchase[6], however manufacturers need to help
users to assess and review their security settings throughout the life of their
devices. This could take the form of periodic notiﬁcations on the device or asso-
ciated app, reminding users to check key risk areas for a given device. This, of
course, may be device speciﬁc, but manufacturers could use the opportunity to
target common areas of concern based upon market intelligence or user research
to ensure that users are given an opportunity to secure the most pressing risks.
Manufacturers should avoid confusion by only providing guidance that is in line
with the regional governmental cyber security agency, or in the case of inter-
national manufacturers, picking advice from respected agencies or bodies, and
referencing and linking back to those bodies so that users can see the underlying
guidance themselves. As the results of the website review show, conﬂicting ad-
vice is abundant as a result of the number of expert opinions in the ﬁeld, and so
manufacturers can help users understand why they are promoting the security
practices that they are. This also provides users an opportunity to learn about
the evolving nature of cyber security information, and promotes the need for
periodic reviews of the user’s security setup. Making users aware that guidance
is dynamically evolving, and explaining how they will receive updated advice, is
crucial, and facilitates user learning.

Before being able to manage risks eﬀectively, however, users need to have
more meaningful guidance about the types of threats that their devices may
pose, so that they can appropriately evaluate what risk management means
to them. This is a complex area, given the potential for misuse, abuse, and
power imbalances [5]. However, manufacturers of devices could produce and point
users to common device use cases, for example, with diﬀerent permutations of
household device use (including how children and visitors may use the device).
These use cases could explain the potential threats to the device in the situation,
the implications of those threats, and how to mitigate those risks based upon
the security features of the device. This would also be beneﬁcial for ISPs to oﬀer
their customers in relation to home router setup, to ensure insecure devices do
not pose unexpected threats, both inside and outside of the home.

6 Limitations and Future Work

This work was an exploratory piece of research, to determine what the Internet
oﬀered users when a number of generalised queries, and searches based upon the
most popular devices reported in a recent survey were undertaken. The queries

Finding Security Advice for Smart Home Devices

11

were researcher-generated, meaning that they may not exactly reﬂect the types
of queries typical home users would perform. Decisions to limit the pages used
in the search may also not reﬂect a user’s behaviour when looking for a speciﬁc
answer. While we did our best to mirror a reasonable keyword selection process
and user-oriented approach to pages viewed, future work should involve users
to generate these search terms, and use a more precise understanding of when
users might stop looking for answers on a page. It may also be useful to do a
wider review, as limiting the research to a handful of speciﬁc devices may ignore
advice that is necessary for the security of other types of devices. The search
results also point to the complex role that routers have in the smart home.
Repeating the work with routers included as a speciﬁcally searched-for device
may be beneﬁcial.

7 Conclusions

Through a review of web pages, this research has shown that ﬁnding reputable,
actionable and coherent guidance on how to approach securing home IoT de-
vice against cyber security threats is challenging. Users are confronted by an
overwhelming number of resources, often with little direct credibility or spe-
ciﬁc actionable advice. We consider that improvements could be made by device
manufacturers in particular in creating clearer, more actionable content, as well
as a need for search engine results to reﬂect more prominently those resources
from relevant organisations (notably manufacturers and governmental bodies)
to ensure users ﬁnd the most speciﬁc advice for their situation.
