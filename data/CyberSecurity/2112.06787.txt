Abstract—  This  paper  presents  some  recent  trends  in  the 
research  of  grid-interactive  inverters.  Particularly,  this  paper 
focuses on stability, ancillary services,  operation, and security of 
single  and  multiple  inverters  in  the  modern  power  grid.  A grid-
interactive inverter performs as a controllable interface between 
the  distributed  energy  sources  and  the  power  grid.  High-
penetration of inverters in a power distribution system can create 
some technical challenges on the power quality, as well as voltage 
and frequency control of the system. In particular, a weak grid can 
lead to voltage oscillation and consequently instability. Moreover, 
the  power  grid  is  moving  toward  becoming  a  cyber-physical 
system  in  which  smart  inverters  can  exchange  information  for 
power  marketing  and  economic  dispatching.  This  puts  the 
inverters  at  the  risk  of  insecure  operations.  Hence,  security 
enhancement  has  become  another  primary  concern.  Finally,  the 
grid-interactive  inverters  are  operated  proportional  power-
sharing  while  operating  together  with  many  inverters.  Recent 
research on coordinated operations is also discussed in this paper.

I.  INTRODUCTION

to  as  grid-interactive 

The modern electric power grid is gradually changing  with 
the 
introduction  of  power  electronics  converter-based 
distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic (PV) 
arrays, wind turbines, battery energy storage, and natural gas-
powered  microturbines.  Solid-state  converters  serve  as  the 
controllable  interface between the distributed  sources and  the 
power grid when power is generated from these sporadic dc and 
ac  sources.  Multiple  stages  are  usually  present  in  these 
converters, with an inverter serving as the grid-side stage. These 
are 
the 
decentralized generation units are called distributed generators 
(DGs) [1]-[3]. Grid-interactive inverters enable high integration 
of renewable energy sources while also allowing for remote and 
dynamic control [4]-[6]. In North America, several states have 
integrated  renewable  energy  resources  in  their  power  system 
planning for the future. Los Angles, California aims to achieve 
100% of renewable electricity by 2045 along with aggressive 
electrification 
[7]. 
Furthermore, California's total solar power generation is nearly 
13%, with certain places generating as much as 25% [8]. In [9], 
it is reported that California has aimed to generate 50% of its 
energy from renewable sources by 2030.

The  increasing  penetration  of  DGs  allows  for  greater 
flexibility in power networks, where grid-interactive inverters 
are vital parts of the modern power network [10]-[11]. Fig. 1. 
depicts  a  modern  grid-interactive  inverter  with  multiple 
responsibilities. For instance, smart inverters can be configured 
to  provide  ancillary  services  for  the  power  network  during 
improving  power  quality.  This 
abnormal  circumstances, 

operation  procedure  for  inverters  is  called  grid-supporting 
mode  [1],  [12].  The  widespread  use  of  DGs  has  many 
advantages,  but  it  also  poses  new  issues  in  terms  of  power 
system stability and reliability [13]-[15]. For example, almost 
zero  inertia  of  inverter-based  DGs  leads  to  low-inertia 
microgrids. A specific case of the low-inertia grid is the weak 
grid, in which an inverter could become unstable and, therefore, 
would  have  to  be  disconnected  from  the  system  [16].  An 
inverter could also trip due to internal faults such as faults in the 
semiconductor  devices.  As  such,  inverters  should  be  able  to 
detect  internal  and  external  abnormalities  and  should  be 
equipped  with control functionalities to operate  effectively  in 
those conditions [17], [18]. Furthermore, the distributed control 
structure of DGs, can allow  the power-sharing between DGs, 
the energy management, and economic dispatch between DGs. 
This  power  marketing  and  economic  dispatching  cannot  be 
achieved  efficiently  without  a  supervisory  control  structure 
requiring  communication  between  a  utility  operator  and 
inverters [18], [19]. Thus, a grid-interactive inverter becomes a 
cyber-physical  system  that  includes  physical  parts,  e.g. 
modules,  measurement  sensors,  signal  processors,  and  data 
packet communications. This  new cyber-physical structure of 
inverters has numerous benefits but can cause new stability and 
security  risks  in  the  power  grid  [19]-[21].  For  example,  the 
communication-enabled  inverters  could  be  at  risk  of  being 
hacked, thus endangering the inverter's security [22], [23].   

This paper intends to provide a  systematic  overview of the 
grid-interactive  inverters.  In  addition  to  this  introduction 
section, the grid-interactive inverters modeling is presented in 
section II. Section II also discusses the stability analysis under 
different  grid  conditions.  Section  III  discusses  the  ancillary

II.  MODELING AND STABILITY ANALYSIS OF GRID-
INTERACTIVE INVERTERS 

Grid-interactive  inverters  are  highly  susceptible  to  grid 
anomalies.  The  problem  is  most  noticeable  in  stand-alone 
inverter operation and weak grids [24]. A weak grid is formed 
as power grids having a low short-circuit ratio (SCR), i.e., high 
impedance  and  low  inertia  [25].  Variable  impedance  in  the 
weak  grids  can  cause  unwanted  resonance  and  instability  for 
grid-interactive  systems  [26].  Additionally,  the  interface 
between the controllers and grid fluctuations leads to instability 
in weak grids [24], [27]. Notably, increasing grid impedances 
can  degrade  the  performance  phase-locked  loop  (PLL)  and 
negatively  affect 
the  grid-interactive  system’s  stability. 
Furthermore,  in  [28],  it  has  been  shown  that  the  positive 
feedback gain of anti-islanding methods, a required feature for 
distributed sources, is limited the stable operation in weak grids. 
Therefore, it is apparent that weak grids severely degrade grid-
tied  inverter  stability.  This  section  discussed  the  control  and 
transient stability of grid-interactive inverter systems. 

A.  Modeling of Grid-Interactive Inverter: 

For design and analytical purposes, detailed dynamic models 
of the grid-interactive inverters are required. However, due to 
the non-linearity of grid-interactive inverters, i.e., VSI and CSI, 
the  development  of  dynamic  models  that  can  accurately 
describe  their  behavior  is  a  complex  task.  Notice,  a  VSI  is  a 
buck inverter, whereas a CSI can operate as a boost inverter. A 
control block of grid-interactive VSI is shown in Fig. 2. In CSI, 
the dc-bus capacitor is replaced by dc-link inductors, 𝐿𝑑𝑐. The 
state-space-averaged 
representation  of  open-loop  grid-
connected CSI in the rotating 𝑑𝑞-frame of reference is derived 
in [29]-[31]. The state-space-averaged representation of open-
loop grid-connected VSI in the rotating 𝑑𝑞-frame of reference 
is  derived  in  [24]. The  small-signal  model  of  the  closed-loop 
system for VSI and CSI has been formulated in [24], [29]-[33] 
by replacing the open-loop control inputs with the closed-loop 
control  inputs.  These  small-signal  models  have  been  used  to 
analyze  the  system  stability  through  eigenvalue  trajectories 
[24],  [34].  The  stability  of  the  CSI  boost  inverter  with  the 
variation  in  input  signals  is  studied  in  [35]-[36].  In  [24],  the 
effects of the grid, control scheme, and filter parameters on the 
stability of PQ-controlled grid-interactive VSI are studied using 
a  twelfth-order  state-space  model.  A  full-order  inverter 
dynamic  model  appropriately  represents  a  DG  unit-based 
system  [24].  To  perform  the  stability  analysis  of  a  system 
comprising  multiple  DG  units,  a  full-order  model  of  the 
individual unit needs to be determined and then aggregated to 
represent  the  actual  system.  The  system  model  could  be 
complicated  because  of  the  integration  of  several  full-order 
models.  Therefore,  the  detailed  inverter  model  is  usually 
interpreted as a simplified reduced-order model by substituting 
the  inverter  by  an  ideal  voltage  source  (for  VSI)  or  current 
source (for CSI), avoiding the output filter, and neglecting the 
grid  impedance.  One  way  of  eliminating  the  complexity  of  a

detailed  model  is  to  present  each  inverter  by  a  reduced-order 
dynamic  model  resulting  from  its  full-order  model.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  developed  reduced-order  model 
should  capture  the  key  feature  of  the  actual  system  while 
considerably reducing computational difficulties. In [24], [37], 
a second reduced-order model of a VSI has been developed to 
represent actual system characteristics. 

B.  Stability Enhancement in Weak Grids 

Grid-interactive  inverters should be equipped with stability 
improvement  features  for  operation  in  weak  grid  conditions. 
According  to  the  IEEE  Std.  1547.7-2013,  a  weak  grid  is 
characterized  by  a  large  impedance  between  the  PCC  of  the 
inverter and its primary voltage source, e.g., a substation [24]. 
Along with the grid impedance, the severity of the weak grid 
condition is also affected by the size of the DG units compared 
to the  size of the distribution  network [36], and also islanded 
microgrids are particularly vulnerable to weak grids. A voltage 
fluctuation can be occurred due to the weak grids. When a weak 
grid condition passes a specific limit, an unstable operation can 
be  observed,  resulting  in  sudden  inverter  disconnection  [36]-
[39].  A  cascaded  failure  event  can  also  be  observed  as  a 
consequence  of  sudden  inverter  disconnection  [40]-[42]. 
Therefore,  inverter  controllers  should  be  equipped  with 
appropriate  features  to  handle  the  stability  issues  associated 
with weak grids. Different stabilizing method for small-signal 
stability enhancement for grid-interactive inverter in week grids 
is summarized in Table I.

A  voltage  feedforward  element,  based  on  the  voltage 
measured at the PCC, is usually added to the control scheme of 
inverters  to  achieve  faster  dynamic  performance.  However, 
under weak grid conditions, the voltage feedforward term could 
make  the  inverter  more  susceptible  to  instability  [24],  [43], 
[44]. Thus, the voltage feedforward term needs to be modified 
to ensure stability in weak grids, and some recent works in [1], 
[24],  [45]  feedforward  term  was  modified  to  improve  the 
stability  in  weak  grids.  In  [46],  the  feedforward  term  was 
modified  through  a  delay  compensation  function,  where  the 
delay compensation transfer function was derived for one and a 
half  sampling  period  delay.  The  inverter  displayed  improved 
robustness  to  grid  impedance  variation  with  the  modified 
feedforward  term.  A  capacitor  voltage  feedforward  term  was 
also considered in [47], with the feedforward term added to the 
control scheme through a first-order filter and a constant gain 
term. The gain term can be designed to make the inverter robust 
under weak grid conditions. In [48], PCC voltage feedforward 
was employed through a filter and a gain block. It was shown 
that for the modified voltage feedforward with a suitable value 
of  the  gain  block  between  0  and  1,  the  performance  of  the 
inverter displayed improvements under weak grids. Increasing 
the grid-side filter inductance, 𝐿2 of LCL filter could result in 
stable  inverter  operation  at  weak  grids  as  demonstrated 
analytically in [49]. The authors developed a virtual inductance 
feedforward  control  strategy  emulating  the  characteristics  of 
extra inductance in the grid-side filter inductance. The value of 
virtual  inductance  must  be  selected  carefully  to  ensure  the 
stable  operation  of  the  inverter  in  weak  grids  [49].  Although 
each  of 
techniques  described  above 
demonstrated  improved  performance  in  weak  grids,  they  all 
have one common shortcoming. Each one of these techniques 
requires  manual  tuning  of  the  feedforward  term.  As  a  result, 
they will be challenging to implement in practical applications 
where the grid impedance will be unknown.

The  adaptive  techniques  use  the  same  principles  as  the 
previously described techniques to improve inverter stability in 
weak grids, though they have an adaptive element, which makes 
them  suitable  for  inverters  [50],  [51].  An  adaptive  control 
scheme that relies on the real-time estimation of grid impedance 
has been developed in [51] to enhance the stability of inverters. 
In  [52],  an  active  damper  was  added  to  the  system,  which 
essentially introduces an additional resistive term in the inverter 
circuit that can be varied adaptively to make the inverter more 
robust against changes in grid impedance. The active damper 
was  realized  using  an  additional  low-power  single-phase 
inverter, which ensures stability without adding any complexity 
to the controller of the actual inverter, however, it requires extra 
circuitry  contributing  to  additional  size  and  cost.  In  [53],  the 
gain of the voltage feedforward path was updated adaptively to 
enhance  stability  in  weak  grids.  However,  the  technique

impedance  estimation, 
implemented using a band-pass filter, the parameters of which 
were changed manually.

based inverters is increasing in the power grid, they are required 
by  the  utilities  to  stay  connected  to  the  system  under  such 
voltage sags, known as low voltage ride through (LVRT). Smart 
inverters  must be capable  of  identifying such grid anomalies, 
stay connected to the grid, and provide ancillary services [28]-
[29].  The  ancillary  services  of  the  inverter  are  reviewed 
separately for symmetrical and asymmetrical faults below: 

A.  Ancillary Services During Symmetrical Anomalies 

Symmetrical  voltage  sag  happens  when  the  utility  has 
symmetrical  faults.  According  to  previous  utility  standards, 
inverters  were  required  to  disconnect  from  the  grid  during 
voltage sags [54]-[55]. However, as the utilization of inverter-
based renewable sources increases, a sudden loss of power from 
all  the  inverter-based  DGs  could  result  in  a  significant 
consequence than the voltage sag itself. Therefore, inverters are 
required  to  stay  connected  to  the  grid  under  voltage  sags. 
Furthermore, according to some European grid codes [56] and 
IEEE std. 1547-2018 [57], the inverters are required to provide 
reactive  power  support  during  the  grid  voltage  sags.  If  the 
voltage sag exists too long, the inverter should be disconnected 
from  the  grid.  One  important  thing  to  note  is  that  the  active 
current fed to the grid should be adjusted as the reactive current 
is increased to avoid violating the maximum current limit of the 
inverter shown as a circle with a radius of 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 in Fig. 3, which 
would  otherwise  trip  the  inverter  [58],  [59]. Besides  this,  the 
amount  of  active  and  reactive  power  delivered  from  the 
inverter’s terminal to the grid can be formulated as [60], 

𝑆 =

               (1) 

|𝑉𝑖𝑛𝑣||𝑉𝑡ℎ|𝑒−𝑗(𝛿−𝜃𝑍) − |𝑉𝑡ℎ|2𝑒𝑗(𝜃𝑍)
|𝑍|
where,  𝑉𝑖𝑛𝑣 = |𝑉𝑖𝑛𝑣|∠𝛿  and  𝑉𝑡ℎ = |𝑉𝑡ℎ|∠0  are  respectively 
the inverter output and grid Thevenin voltages,  𝛿 is the angle 
difference  between  the  inverter  and  grid  voltages.  𝑍 = (𝑍𝑓 +
𝑍𝑡ℎ)∠𝜃𝑍  is  the  impedance  seen  from  the  inverter’s  output 
terminals. Herein, the inverter’s fundamental output voltage can 
be represented as 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑣 = (𝑘𝑚,𝑖)𝑉𝑑𝑐sin (𝜔𝑡 + 𝛿), where 𝑘𝑚,𝑖 is 
the DC-bus utilization factor. For three-phase  grid-interactive 
inverters  using  sinusoidal  PWM  (SPWM)  and  space-vector 
PWM or SPWM+3rd harmonics techniques, 𝑘𝑚,1 becomes,

     (2) 

where,  0 < 𝑚 ≤ 1  denotes  the  modulation  index.  When  the 
inverter operates in a nonlinear region, this utilization ratio can 
be  violated  due  to  over-modulation,  also  known  as  pulse 
dropping,  and  more  harmonics  can  be  observed  since  the 
system operates in a nonlinear region [1], [11]. The maximum 
limit (boundary of instability) in which an inverter is capable 
of  utilizing  the  DC-bus  voltage  can  be  defined  using  𝑘𝑚2 =
𝑚(4√3)/(2𝜋√2) because the RMS value of the fundamental 
component of a square waveform is 4 𝜋⁄ . Based on the Fourier 
series, a voltage source inverter (VSI) cannot utilize the DC-
bus voltage  more than  𝑘𝑚2 ratio, in theory [36]. Eq.1 can be 
represented as a circle with the radii for linear and nonlinear 
operating boundaries, 𝑅𝑖, and center, 𝐶, can be written as

represented  as  the  overlap  area  of  the  inner  circle  with  𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 
boundary.  The  area  outside  the  inner  circle  with  a  radius  𝑅1 
enclosed by the intersected area of the 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 circle with the outer 
circle  with  radius  𝑅2  defines  the  nonlinear  operating  region. 
Grid-supporting inverters extract the maximum available power 
from  the  intermittent  source,  e.g.,  PV  arrays,  and  feed  to  the 
grid. In DG units, voltage source inverters (VSIs) are typically 
utilized,  but  current  source  inverters  (CSIs)  can  also  be  used 
[31]-[33]. A CSI, unlike a VSI, is a boost inverter that may be 
fed by a parallel connection of small dc sources, improving the 
reliability and availability of DG units [61]. 

B.  Ancillary Services During Asymmetrical Anomalies 

Due  to  asymmetrical  faults  in  the  utility  and  uneven 
distribution  of  single-phase  loads  in  the  distribution  network, 
asymmetrical  voltage  sag  could  develop  [36],  [62].  The 
asymmetrical  faults  can  be  categorized  as  single-phase  to 
ground  fault,  two-phase  to  ground  fault,  and  phase  to  phase 
fault [25]. In such situations, an inverter can assist the grid by 
providing negative-sequence compensation services in addition 
to  positive-sequence  reactive  power  assistance  [63].  The 
voltage  imbalance  factor  (VUF)  of  the  PCC  voltages  can  be 
used to identify asymmetrical voltage sag. There would be no 
need for additional sensors because PCC voltages are already 
monitored.  Two  current  control  loops  can  be  added  to  the 
control scheme for providing negative-sequence compensation 
to the grid currents, irrespective of whether the control scheme 
is  based  on  stationary  reference  frame  components  or 
synchronous reference frame components [1], [64]. The newly 
added  control  loops  will  operate  based  on  the  negative-

sequence components of the grid current as shown in Fig. 3, and 
the setpoints of the controllers can be set at any value other than 
zero  to  mitigate  some  of  the  oscillations.  A  common-mode 
injection scheme can be added to the control scheme to limit the 
inverter  references  in  the  linear  modulation  region  while 
providing  ancillary  services  [42].  Therefore,  a  smart  inverter 
equipped with a common-mode injection scheme can maximize 
its dc-bus voltage utilization. 

Phase-angle  detection  in  abnormal  three-phase  systems  is 
still  a  challenging  task  for  enhancing  the  stability  margin  of 
grid-tied  smart  inverters.  To  increase  the  inverters  resiliency, 
advanced phase-angle detection schemes are needed. A direct 
phase-angle detection method has been presented in [65]. This 
feature consists of a direct instantaneous phase-angle detector 
capable of accurately detecting the phase-angle of the desired 
reference voltage under unbalanced grid conditions.  Accurate 
phase-angle  detection  is  a  vital  function  of  the  self-learning 
inverter  as  it  is  used  in  the  synchronization  and  controller 
scheme computations of the inverter [66]. 

IV.  SECURITY OF GRID-INTERACTIVE INVERTER  

Recent  developments 

in  communication  and 

internet 
in  grid-interactive 
technologies  allow  advanced  features 
inverters. The inverters connected to communication or cyber 
network  could  be  in  danger  of  being  hacked.  This  section 
discusses grid-interactive inverters as a part of a cyber-physical 
system  and  a  review  of  possible  cyber-attacks  and  security 
assessments.   

A.  Cyber-Physical Devices and Possible Attack scenario 

Grid-interactive inverters in a cyber-physical power grid and 
possible cyberattack scenarios targeting the inverter are shown 
in Fig. 5.  Inverter control systems  need system parameters to 
perform  control  actions  and  achieve  desired  operating 
conditions. These parameters can be received as external data. 
For example, the grid-interactive inverter controllers can obtain 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         
  
 
 
 
 
  
measurement  data  from  smart  devices,  power  setpoints  from 
utility  services,  forecasting  data  from  weather  services,  etc. 
Communication  with  multiple  parties  through  the  cyber 
network  allows  autonomous  interactions  and  information 
exchange;  however,  it  entails  more  surface  for  harmful 
activities,  specifically  when  the  communication  protocols  are 
insecure,  operating  system  software,  and  user  credential 
information are outdated [4], [67],[68]. These activities can be 
represented as intentional and unintentional unsafe events that 
can impede the normal operation of the inverters. For instance, 
an authorized utility operator can unintentionally  send unsafe 
𝑃𝑄 setpoints that can operate the inverter beyond its capability 
limit  or  cause  pulse  dropping  and  high  total  harmonic 
distortions (THD) [69]. On the contrary, an unauthorized user 
can  intentionally  change  measurement  data  received  from  an 
external  sensor.  The  most  challenging  aspect  of  operating  a 
communication-enabled  device  is  to  ensure  security  since 
hackers  want  to  jeopardize  the  operation  of  the  inverters.  In 
particular, as inverter-based has low inertia, they are vulnerable 
to sudden changes in operating point that can cause voltage sags 
or swells and the instability of the controllers that can lead to 
cascaded  inverter  trips  [70],  [71].  Insecure  communication 
protocols,  outdated  software,  weak  user  credentials  allow 
hackers  to  breach  the  inverter  system  via  the  communication 
link  and  perform  the  data  modifications.  Possible  attack 
scenarios are security certificate proof, brute force credentials 
(BFC),  man-in-the-middle  (MITM),  denial  of  service  (DoS), 
replaying, eavesdropping, etc., as discussed in [10]. 

B.  Detection and Protection Against Probable Cyber Attacks 
 In  recent  years,  cyber-attack  identification  and  prevention 
have been a trending research area. Despite various researches 
being  ongoing,  no  investigation  can  guarantee  the  secure 
operation  of  devices  that  are  connected  to  the  cyber-physical 
system. 
literature,  numerous  cyberattack  detection 
algorithms  have  been  developed,  which  include  advanced 
communication  protocol,  intensive  computation  process,  i.e., 
machine-learning  algorithm  to  ensure  security  against  cyber-
attacks. 

In 

 Some  research  includes  knowledge-based  techniques  to 
ensure  the  safe  operation  of  the  inverters  [71].  Hackers  can 
bypass  security  protocols,  authentication  restrictions,  user 
interface  firewalls,  and  other  barriers  by  using  their  coding 
skills and performing cyber-attacks. The literature in [9], [72] 
emphasizes  data  transfer  security  to  provide  security  against 
cyberattacks.  These  solutions,  however,  are  inadequate  to 
address  the  security  issue  with  smart  inverters.  Hence, 
protection  beyond  network  security  is  required  to  ensure  the 
inverter’s  safe  operation.  The  safe  operation  can  be 
accomplished  by  creating  techniques  based  on  system  and 
device-level data. System-level techniques use system data sent 
from the neighboring cyber-physical devices and controllers to 
investigate whether there is a cyber-attack. In [73]-[74], a data-
driven  method  such  as  machine  learning  is  used  to  ensure 
system-level security. 

C.  Inverter Self-Security 

Despite  the  fact  that  many  investigations  on  software  and 
system-level  security  have  been 
reported,  device-level 
detection  is  suggested  in  [10].  A  model-based  self-security

algorithm was first developed in [71]. The authors underlined 
that model-based approaches could be included in the inverter 
control  circuit  to  inspect  the  validity  of  incoming  power 
setpoints.  The  model-based  device-level  security  technique  is 
depicted in Fig. 6. In [69], [71], three reference model has been 
utilized to guarantee the inverter security. The utilized reference 
models include maximum inverter capability, 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥As shown in 
Fig. 2, instability boundary, utilizing the concept from [42] and 
[58],  and  examine  dynamic  performance  using  the  reduced-
order  digital-twin  model  to  represent  the  actual  dynamic 
behavior and to achieve faster operations [69], [71]. In addition 
to  the  models  discussed  in  [71],  IEEE  1547-2018  standards 
requirements  such  as  high-voltage  ride-through  (HVRT)  and 
low-voltage  ride-through  (LVRT)  can  be  applied  as  an 
additional  knowledge-based  model  to  ensure  safe  operation. 
Therefore,  a  self-security  algorithm  can  ensure  a  secure 
operation by detecting anomalies in the incoming data. When 
adequate information is provided to the inverter, it can learn its 
dynamic  performance,  stability  boundaries,  and  maximum 
capabilities. The inverter can safeguard itself and the utility grid 
from  abnormal  operation  when  the  reference  model  is 
appropriately formed.

V.  MULTI-INVERTER OPERATION 

The  coordinated  operation  between  the  multiple  inverters 
ensures  a  more  secured  environment  under  adverse  grid 
conditions  and  external  attacks.  Seamless  synchronization  is 
necessary  for  multiple  inverters  operating  in  a  system.  Most 
synchronization  techniques  address  the  connection  of  an 
inverter  or  a  microgrid  to  a  power  grid.  For  example, 
synchronization methods for seamless transitions between grid-
tied and stand-alone modes of a single inverter are reported in 
[75]-[79].  The  microgrid  (re)connection  to  a  power  grid  is 
reported in [80], where the inverters follow the grid frequency 
using secondary control schemes such that the frequency of the 
grid  and  microgrid 
remains  unchanged  during  any 
synchronization process. In most reported studies, the inverters 
change  their  mode  of  operation  to  grid-following  after  the 
process of synchronization [81]-[85]. In [86], communication 
infrastructure  is  implemented  for  synchronization,  and  droop 
controls  are  not  applied.  The  synchronization  issue  of  an 
inverter  as  part  of  a  microgrid  fed  by  multiple  inverters  is 
addressed  in  [87].  A  seamless  synchronization  method  of 
inverters  for  microgrid  operation  has  been  developed.  The 
strategy ensures seamless and secure connection/reconnection 
for new inverters added to the system, as well as ensuring equal 
power-sharing of incoming sources [88].  

PLL  malfunctioning  can  cause  an  inverter  to  lose  the 
synchronization,  consequently  shutting  down  the  inverter 
operation,  leading  to  significant  power  loss.  In  literature, 
numerous  synchronization  methods  have  been  developed  for 
abnormal  grid  circumstances  [89],  including  advanced  PLL 
designs [90], compensating impedance, and feedforward design 
to  avoid  such  situations  [91]-[93].  Several  PLL-free  fast  and 
robust  phase-angle  detection  techniques  were  developed  in 
[94]-[95].  These  PLL-less  phase-angle  detection  methods  are 
compatible when traditional generation units are involved. To 
resolve  the  problem  of  PLL  misfunctioning,  a  cooperative 
strategy has been developed in [66]. 

Single-phase  microgrids  feeders  can  be  disconnected  and 
operate  as  stand-alone  microgrids  with  sufficient  DGs  after 
losing  the  utility.  Placement  of  interphase  AC-AC  inverters 
between islanded single-phase feeders have been recommended 
for power flow control between the feeders [65],[97]. Here, the 
three single-phase feeder’s phase sequences remain the same as 
actual  𝑎𝑏𝑐-sequence  [65],  [97].  As  a  part  of  the  coordinated 
operation, a strategy for three single-phase to one single phase 
microgrid  development  to  fulfill  the  load  demands  has  been 
developed in [98]-[100].  

VI.  CONCLUSION 

This  paper  highlighted  some  current  contributions  on 
enhancing  the  stability  and  self-security  of  grid-interactive 
inverters. In particular, stability of grid-interactive inverters in 
weak  grids  has  been  discussed  for  different  LCL  filter 
parameters. The recommendation is to add a feedforward path 
in the conventional control scheme that emulates an increased 
grid-side filter inductance effect. Grid-interactive inverters can 
also utilize the maximum dc-bus voltage by adding a nonlinear 
common-mode reference single into the PWM generator while 
providing  harmonic  and  negative  sequence  compensations. 
Basically,  the  linear  modulation  region  of  inverters  can  be 

6 

expanded  by  adding  the  common-mode  reference  signal. 
Autonomous  security  from  cyberattacks  is  another  recent 
research  area  that  has  been  highlighted  in  this  paper.  The 
requirement  for  device-level  security  measures  has  been 
addressed.  The  use  of  reference-model  techniques  has  been 
recommended to ensure the safe operation of the inverter during 
anomalies  and  cyber-attacks.  Also,  this  paper  has  briefly 
discussed  a  multiple-inverter  collaborative  operation  for 
smooth power-sharing and synchronization.
