Abstract—Cyber

the provision of
evidence-based knowledge about existing or emerging threats.
Beneﬁts of threat intelligence include increased situational aware-
ness and efﬁciency in security operations and improved preven-
tion, detection, and response capabilities. To process, analyze,
and correlate vast amounts of threat information and derive
highly contextual intelligence that can be shared and consumed
in meaningful times requires utilizing machine-understandable
knowledge representation formats that embed the industry-
required expressivity and are unambiguous. To a large extend,
this is achieved by technologies like ontologies, interoperabil-
ity schemas, and taxonomies. This research evaluates existing
cyber-threat-intelligence-relevant ontologies, sharing standards,
and taxonomies for the purpose of measuring their high-level
conceptual expressivity with regards to the who, what, why,
where, when, and how elements of an adversarial attack in
addition to courses of action and technical indicators. The results
conﬁrmed that little emphasis has been given to developing a
comprehensive cyber threat intelligence ontology with existing
efforts not being thoroughly designed, non-interoperable and
ambiguous, and lacking semantic reasoning capability.1

Index Terms—threat intelligence, threat information sharing,

I. INTRODUCTION

Defenders utilize multiple diversiﬁed defense products to
prevent, detect, and disrupt incoming attacks. However, the in-
creasing capability, persistence, and complexity of adversarial
attacks have made traditional defense approaches ineffective.
Organized cybercrime is at each peak. PwC’s global eco-
nomic crime survey of 2016 [1] reports that there are organi-
zations that have suffered cybercrime losses over $5 million,
and of these, nearly a third reported losses over $100 million.
Juniper Research [2] reports that cybercrime will increase the
cost of data breaches to $2.1 trillion globally by 2019, four
times the estimated cost of breaches in 2015.

paper’s scope, analysis, and derived conclusions. The original version of this
research is included in the proceedings of the 2017 European Intelligence and
Security Informatics Conference (EISIC).

For enhancing their security posture, defenders recognized
the need to understand threats their organization may face
better and started exchanging threat information aiming one
organization’s detection to become another’s prevention. This
practice has achieved a certain maturity, with organizations
focusing on generating and sharing more contextual and robust
information known as cyber threat intelligence. Organizations
rely on cyber threat intelligence to identify and understand
impending attacks, speed up security operations, and drive and
prioritize the implementation of security controls.

Threat intelligence is referred to as the task of gathering
including context, mechanisms,
evidence-based knowledge,
indicators, implications and actionable advice, about an ex-
isting or emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be
used to inform decisions regarding the subject’s response to
that menace or hazard2. Cyber threat intelligence needs to be
relevant, timely, accurate, actionable, and contextual.

To a large extend, intelligence generation, consumption,
and interpretation should be automated processes that lever-
age machine-understandable representation formats that allow
for scalable processing, correlation, and analysis. A type of
knowledge representation is ontologies. Ontologies encode
knowledge about a particular domain in a structured manner,
leverage logic for performing inference, and are ﬂexible and
modular, allowing them to be easily extended, reﬁned, or
interconnect with other ontologies.

Working towards an ontology for cyber threat intelligence
has its challenges. Our research reports the following as the
largest barriers to overcome:

• little focus on dedicated ontological cyber threat intelli-
gence efforts that can account for the strategic, opera-
tional, and tactical levels;

• ambiguity in deﬁned concepts that prevents ontology

integration and adoption;

• extensive use of prose and limited utilization of existing
taxonomies that undermine the querability of the knowl-
edge base and minimize interoperability and the ability
to perform reasoning;

• lack of relationships between concepts for augmented
cyber threat intelligence interpretation and explainability;
• minimal use of ontology axioms and constructs that can
be used for semantic consistency checking and informa-
tion inference.

This article evaluates taxonomies, sharing standards, and
ontologies relevant to the task of creating a comprehensive
cyber threat intelligence ontology. To achieve that, we created
the cyber threat intelligence model that indicates different
types of information as abstraction layers that all together
elucidate a malicious attack’s ﬁve W’s and one H; who, what,
why, where, when, how, and technical indicators. We pinpoint
the mappings between the cyber threat intelligence model and
the taxonomies, sharing standards, and ontologies evaluated,
aiming to indicate their expressivity. Finally, we critically
review the shortcomings of the current cyber threat intelligence
ontology approaches, and we discuss various directions to
improving their quality.

II. METHODOLOGY

This section introduces two models related to threat detec-
tion maturity and cyber threat intelligence. The two models
overlap, and both can meet different needs that are explained
in the next two subsequent subsections. The Cyber Threat
Intelligence model
is the basis of the evaluation process
conducted in this research.

Fig. 1. Modiﬁed Detection Maturity Level Model [3] [4]

A. The Detection Maturity Level Model - DML

Ryan Stillions proposed the Detection Maturity Level
(DML) model in 2014 [4]. DML is used to describe an organi-
zation’s maturity regarding its ability to consume and act upon
given cyber threat intelligence (Figure 1). Detection maturity
at the higher levels of DML indicates that an organization has
established intelligence-driven processes and procedures for
detecting, understanding, and responding to cyber threats more
effectively and efﬁciently. In 2016, we extended this model by
adding an additional level (9) ”Identity” and presented it for
use in the semantic representation of cyber threats [3].

B. The Cyber Threat Intelligence Model

The Cyber Threat Intelligence model builds upon and
extends [4] and [3], and intends to elucidate the different
types of information an organization needs access to increase
its situational awareness about threats. In this research, we
utilize our model as a measurement standard. We use the
intelligence abstraction
model’s distinguished cyber threat
layers to measure the expressivity of existing taxonomies,
sharing standards, and ontologies.

Fig. 2. Cyber Threat Intelligence Model

The remaining section is devoted to specifying the deﬁni-
tions of the elements comprising the cyber threat intelligence
model.

Identity: the identity of a threat actor can be the real
name of a person, an organization, a group’s afﬁliates, or
a nation-state-backed entity. In cases that attribution is not
feasible, tracking operations via persona-based threat actor
proﬁles also has its beneﬁts as it allows identiﬁcation of an
actor’s behavioral characteristics concerning their motivations,
goals, capability, and TTPs they utilize.

Motivation: can be described as the driving force that
enables actions to pursue speciﬁc goals. The goals of an
attacker may change, but the motivation most of the times
remains the same. Knowing a threat actor’s motivation narrows
down which targets that actor may focus on, helps defenders
focus their limited defensive resources on the most likely
attack scenarios, as well as shapes the intensity and the
persistence of an attack [5]. Examples of motivation can be
ideological, geopolitical, and ﬁnancial.

Goals: according to Fishbach and Ferguson [6] ”a goal is
a cognitive representation of a desired endpoint that impacts
evaluations, emotions, and behaviors”. A goal consists of an
overall end state and the behavior objects and plans needed
for attaining it. The activation of a goal guides behaviors.
Depending on how the attack is organized, the goal might
not be known for the attacking team executing the attack. The
team might only receive a strategy to follow. In current cyber
threat intelligence approaches and knowledge bases goals are

mostly described in prose. A goal can be deﬁned as a tuple of
two: (Action, Object), but work needs to be done to create a
consistent taxonomy at an adequate level of detail [3]. Typical
examples of goals are ”steal intellectual property”, ”damage
infrastructure”, and ”embarrass a competitor”.

Strategy: is a non-technical high-level description of the
planned attack. There are typically multiple ways an attacker
can achieve its goals, and the strategy deﬁnes which approach
the threat agent should follow.

TTPs: tactics, techniques, and procedures are aimed to be
consumed by a more technical audience. TTPs characterize
adversary behavior in terms of what they want to achieve
technically and how they are doing it.

Attack Pattern: is a type of TTP that describes behavior

attackers use to carry out their attacks.

Malware: is a type of TTP and refers to a software that
is inserted into a system with the intent of compromising the
target in terms of conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability.

Infrastructure: describes any systems, software services,
and any associated physical or virtual resources intended to
support an adversarial operation, such as using purchased
domains to support Command and Control, malware delivery
sites, and phishing sites.

Tools: attackers install and use tools within the victim’s
network. Tools encompass both dedicated software developed
for malicious reasons and software intended for different
use (e.g., vulnerability and network scanning, remote process
execution) but utilized for malicious purposes, mainly for
avoiding detection (defense evasion).

Indicators of Compromise: are actionable technical ele-
ments and are directly consumable by cyber defense systems
and components for detecting malicious or suspicious activity.
A good IOC encompasses contextual information in addition
to behavioral, computed, or atomic indicators to assist situa-
tional awareness.

Atomic Indicators: the value of atomic indicators is limited
due to their short shelf life. Atomic indicators include ﬁle
hashes, domain names, and IPs.

Target: represents the entity an attack is directed to and can

be an organization, a sector, a nation, or individuals.

Course of Action: refers to measures that can be taken to

prevent or respond to attacks.

C. Evaluation Criteria

Using open-source information such as published scientiﬁc
works, documentation, and source ﬁles, the next section of
the article presents and analyzes different taxonomies, sharing
standards, and ontologies relevant to cyber threat intelligence.
The conducted analysis/evaluation is based on the following
criteria:

• Identify information and concepts covered in each work
based on the abstraction layers of the Cyber Threat
Intelligence model (Figure 2). Table 1 presents the results.
• Identify integrations (connections) between ontologies,
taxonomies, and cyber threat intelligence sharing schemas
for interoperability (Sections III, IV).

• Characterize the level of comprehensiveness and ade-
quacy of semantic relationships in each work’s conceptual
layers and recognize the use of logics for information
inference (Sections IV, V).

A number of identiﬁed articles present ontologies that are
not described in great detail and have no reference to the actual
ontology ﬁles (RDF/OWL), making their evaluation hard to
achieve. Furthermore, some available ontology efforts do not
offer an additional supporting publication and, most of the
times, not even proper documentation.

III. TAXONOMIES AND SHARING STANDARDS

This section provides an overview of taxonomies and shar-
ing standards that are used or potentially can be used in
cyber threat intelligence representation. We categorize them
as enumerations, scoring systems, and sharing standards.

A. Enumerations

TAL (Threat Agent Library) [7] is a set of standardized
deﬁnitions and descriptions to represent signiﬁcant
threat
agents. The library does not represent individual threat actors,
thus it is not intended to identify people, or investigating actual
security events. The goal of TAL is to help in risk management
and speciﬁcally to identify threat agents relevant to speciﬁc
assets. In that way, security professionals pro-actively can
build defenses for speciﬁc threats.

Casey, in 2015, introduced a new taxonomy for cyberthreat
motivations. The taxonomy identiﬁes drivers that cause threat
actors to commit illegal acts [5]. Knowing these drivers could
indicate the nature of the expected harmful actions.

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) [8] is a list
of records for publicly known information-security vulnerabil-
ities in software packages.

NVD (National Vulnerability Database) [9] is a repository
of standards-based vulnerability management data represented
using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). The
NVD performs analysis on CVEs that have been published to
the CVE dictionary. This analysis results in association impact
metrics (Common Vulnerability Scoring System - CVSS),
vulnerability types (Common Weakness Enumeration - CWE),
and applicability statements (Common Platform Enumeration
- CPE), as well as other pertinent metadata. This data enables
automation of vulnerability management, security measure-
ment, and compliance.

CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) [10] is both a spec-
iﬁcation and a list. The speciﬁcation deﬁnes standardized
machine-readable methods for assigning and encoding names
to IT product classes (software and hardware). The CPE
dictionary provides an agreed-upon list of ofﬁcial CPE names.
CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) [11] is a dictionary
of software and hardware security weaknesses aiming to en-
hance understanding about common ﬂaws and their mitigation.
CAPEC (Common Attack Patterns Enumerations and Char-
acteristics) [12] provides a collection of the most common
attack methods used to exploit known weaknesses.

ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common
Knowledge) [13] is focused on network defense and describes
the operational phases in an adversary’s lifecycle, pre- and
post-exploit, and details the TTPs adversaries use to achieve
their objectives while targeting, compromising, and operating
inside a network. It is a valuable resource to understand better
adversary behavior and can be used for multiple purposes, such
as for adversary emulation, behavioral analytics, cyber threat
intelligence enrichment, defense gap assessment, and red
teaming and SOC maturity assessment. ATT&CK matrices ex-
ist about adversary behavior targeting enterprise environments,
mobile and industrial control systems. Moreover, information
pertinent to software adversaries’ use, mitigation techniques,
procedure examples, and detection recommendations are also
available.

B. Scoring Systems

CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) [14] is a
measurement standard aiming to score vulnerabilities based on
their severity. Combined with timely CTI, CVSS can inform an
organization about which vulnerability remediation activities
should prioritize.

CWSS (Common Weakness Scoring System) [15] is part
of CWE and it provides a mechanism for scoring weaknesses
using 18 different factors. It is worth mentioning that Mitre’s
Common Weakness Risk Analysis Framework (CWRAF) can
be used in conjunction with CWSS to identify the most impor-
tant CWEs applying to a particular business and their deployed
technologies. The difference between CVSS and CWSS is that
the ﬁrst one targets speciﬁc software vulnerabilities scoring,
whereas the latter one targets CWE scoring.

C. Sharing Standards

A study of existing threat intelligence sharing initiatives
concluded that Structured Threat
Information eXpression
(STIX) is currently the most used standard for sharing threat
information [16]. STIX is an expressive, ﬂexible, and exten-
sible representation language used to communicate an over-
all piece of threat information [17]. The STIX architecture
comprises different cyber threat information elements such
as cyber observables, indicators, incidents, adversaries tactics,
techniques, procedures, exploit targets, courses of action, cyber
attack campaigns, and threat actors. Furthermore, STIX was
recently redesigned and as a result omits some of the objects
and properties deﬁned in the ﬁrst version. The objects chosen
for inclusion in the second version represent a minimally vi-
able product that fulﬁlls basic consumer and producer require-
ments for cyber threat intelligence sharing. Both standards
can be used and adapted based on an organization’s needs. It
is worth pointing out that MITRE additionally offers MAEC
(Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization) [18],
a very expressive malware sharing language for encoding and
communicating high-ﬁdelity information about malware based
upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns.
MAEC can be integrated in STIX or used as a standalone.

OpenIOC, developed by Mandiant, is an extensible XML
schema that enables you to describe the technical characteris-
tics that identify a known threat, an attacker’s methodology, or
other evidence of compromise. The types of information cov-
ered directly by OpenIOC are derived mainly by enriched low-
level atomic indicators, comprising indicators of compromise,
thus covering the IOC category of the cyber threat intelligence
model.

IV. ONTOLOGIES

Since the work of Blanco et al. [19] in 2008, we have
not found any overviews of existing ontologies within the
cyber security domain. The authors remark that the scientiﬁc
community has not accomplished a general security ontology
because most of the works are focused on speciﬁc domains or
the semantic web. The same conclusion was drawn by Fenz
and Ekelhart [20]. Additionally, Blanco et al. [19] emphasize
the complication of combining their identiﬁed ontologies due
to the non-common interpretation and different terms applied
to similar concepts in different ontologies. Our study conﬁrms
the same almost 10 years after the study of Blanco et al. [19].
While several ontologies relevant to the broader cybersecu-
rity domain exist, only a small number was identiﬁed relating
to threat information and threat intelligence representation. For
a number of them, identifying the mappings to the abstraction
layers of the cyber threat intelligence model is challenging
because they are described only at a very high level and
without having any relevant RDF/OWL ﬁles available for
further investigation. The ontologies analyzed hereafter are
listed chronologically based on their publication date.

Stefan Fenz and Andreas Ekelhat [20] described an infor-
mation security ontology that can be used to support a broad
range of information security risk management methodologies.
The high-level concepts of the ontology are derived from the
security relationship model described in the National Institute
of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-12. Con-
cepts to represent the information security domain knowledge
include threat, vulnerability, control, attribute, and rating. In
addition, concepts such as asset, organization, and person
are necessary to formally describe organizations and their
assets. Lastly, the concept of location is integrated combined
with a probability rating concept to interrelate location and
threat information in order to assign priory threat probabilities.
Like other works,
the authors have difﬁculties connecting
ambiguous concepts deriving from different standards (e.g.,
ambiguous distinction between a threat and a vulnerability).

Wang and Guo [21] proposed an ontology for vulnerability
management and analysis (OVM) populated with all existing
vulnerabilities in NVD. The basis of the ontology is built
on the results of CVE and its related standards, such as
CWE, CPE, CVSS, and CAPEC. OVM captures the relation-
ships between the following concepts which constitute the
top level of the ontology; vulnerability, introduction phase
(software development life cycle - time periods during which
the vulnerability can be introduced), active location (location
of the software where the ﬂaw manifests), IT product, IT

vendor, product category (such as web browsers, application
servers, etc.), attack (integration of CAPEC), attack intent,
attack method, attacker (human being or software agent),
consequence, and countermeasure.

Obrst et al. [22] suggested a methodology for creating an
ontology based on already well-deﬁned ontologies that can
be used as modular sub-ontologies. In addition, they remark
the usefulness of existing schemas, dictionaries, glossaries,
and standards as a form of knowledge acquisition of the
domain by identifying and analyzing entities, relationships,
properties, attributes, and range of values that can be used
in deﬁning an ontology. Their suggested ontology is based on
the diamond model of malicious activity [23], which expresses
the relationships between an adversary (actor), the capabilities
of the adversary, the infrastructure or resources the adversary
utilizes, and the target of the adversary (victim). The authors
state that they developed ﬁrst the aspects of infrastructure
and capabilities, but they are still not in the level of detail
they desire. In addition, their current ontology is focused on
malware and some preliminary aspects of the diamond model.
A good argumentation for transitioning from taxonomies
to ontologies for intrusion detection was made in 2003, by
Undercoffer et al. [24]. They suggested an ontology that
would enable distributed anomaly-based host IDS sensors to
contribute to a common knowledge-base, which again would
enable them to detect quicker a possible attack.

Based on this, More et al. [25] in 2012, suggested to build a
knowledge-base with reasoning capabilities to take advantage
of an extended variety of heterogeneous data sources, to be
able to identify threats and vulnerabilities. Their data sources
suggest that data retrieved and included in the ontology is
within the atomic indicators category of the CTI model.

Oltramari et al. [26] proposed a three-layer cyber secu-
rity ontology named ”CRATELO” aiming at improving the
situational awareness of security analysts, resulting in op-
timal operational decisions through semantic representation.
Following the methodology of [22], the authors build upon
existing ontologies and extend them. Speciﬁcally, CRATELO
includes the top-level ontology DOLCE-SPRAY extended with
security-related middle-level ontology (SECCO) capable of
capturing details of domain speciﬁc scenarios, such as threat,
vulnerability, attack, countermeasure, and asset. The low-level
sub-ontology, cyber operations (OSCO), is the extension of
the middle-level ontology.

Gregio et al. [27] suggested an ontology to address the
detection of modern complex malware families whose infec-
tions involve sets of multiple exploit methods. To achieve
this, they created a hierarchy of main behaviors each one of
them consisting of a set of suspicious activities. Then they
proposed an ontology that models the knowledge on malware
behavior. They state that a given program behaves suspiciously
if it presents one or more of the six events (main behaviors)
described below which consist of several characteristics. The
events are attack launching, evasion, remote control, self-
defense, stealing, and subversion. When new set of process
actions with malicious behaviors appear (input from ”trans-

formed” log ﬁles), the ontology can be inferred to see if an
instance of suspicious execution is linked to a malware sample.
Salem and Wacek [28] designed a data extraction tool called
TAPIO (Targeted Attack Premonition using Integrated Opera-
tional data), specializing in extracting data (through the use of
natural language processing) and automatically mapping that
data into a fully linked semantic graph accessible in real-time.
Part of TAPIO is a cybersecurity ontology known as Integrated
Cyber Analysis System (ICAS) that ingests extracted data
(logs and events) from several sources to provide relationships
across an enterprise network. The tool aims to help incident
response teams connect and correlate events and actions into
an ontology for automatic interpretation. ICAS is a collection
of 30 sub-ontologies specializing in speciﬁc conceptual areas
as part of host-based and network-based conceptual models.
Iannacone et al. [29] described their STUCCO ontology,
which is developed to work on top of a knowledge graph
database. The STUCCO ontology design is based upon scenar-
ios of use by both human and automated users and incorporates
data from 13 different structured data sources with different
format. The data included in the current STUCCO ontology
fall

indicators of our cyber threat intelligence model. Their future
work included extending the ontology to support STIX.

into the categories identity, TTPs,

Gregio, Bonacin, de Marchi, Nabuco, and de Geus [30]
extended the work of Gregio et al. [27] and introduced the
malicious behavior ontology (MBO). MBO is capable of
detecting modern complex malware families whose infections
involve sets of multiple exploit methods, by applying SWRL
rules to the ontology for inferencing. In addition, these rules
also apply metrics to specify whether a program is behaving
maliciously or not and speciﬁcally, how suspicious the ex-
ecution of a program is. The authors state that their model
is able to detect unknown malicious programs even in cases
where traditional security mechanisms like antivirus are not,
by performing automatic inference of suspicious executions in
monitored target systems. However, the current state of the
ontology has some limitations such as performance issues,
cannot detect malware in real time, and false positives and
negatives. Based on its operation MBO can provide useful
indicators of compromise for malware.

Fusun et al. suggested ontologies like attacks, systems,
defenses, missions, and metrics for quantifying attack surfaces
[31]. Their Attack Surface Reasoning (ASR) gives a cyber
defender the possibility to explore trade-offs between cost and
security when deciding on their cyber defense composition.
ASR is mainly modeled after the Microsoft STRIDE [32]
threat classiﬁcation framework, which categorizes attack steps
into 6 categories and is to the extent of our knowledge not the
preferred framework within threat intelligence community due
to its lack of details. In comparison, CAPEC and CPE have
around 500 and 1000 categories, respectively.

As part of their study on using security metrics for security
modeling, Pendelton et al. suggested the Security Metric
Ontology [33]. The ontology includes four sub-ontologies;
vulnerability, attack, situations and defense mechanisms, and

a comprehensive and unambiguous cyber threat intelligence
ontology.

Ontologies are modular and extensible, allowing replacing
or integrating with other domain-focused ontologies to build
a more holistic one that can beneﬁt from an augmented
representation regarding a domain of interest. In the ontologies
evaluated, we identiﬁed that the lack of OWL expressions is a
common phenomenon. Expressions make ontologies powerful
by encoding domain expertise for reasoning. Using the en-
coded knowledge, a reasoner can infer new information from
the existing asserted information at machine speed, introducing
a form of automation.

Furthermore, we cannot ignore mentioning the limited tax-
onomy encodings and integrations we observed and the miss-
ing interconnections between those taxonomies and existing
ontologies for establishing more standardized (interoperabil-
ity) and expressive representations that resolve ambiguity, like
taxonomies that standardize threat actor motivations, goals,
and types. The importance of standardizing and utilizing
taxonomies is apparent in cases where higher querability levels
are desired.

Overall, an ontology gives access to a knowledge base
containing rich historical and present information in a robust,
meaningful, and explicable way. Analysts can utilize a cyber
threat intelligence ontology to perform analytical tasks while
decreasing the conﬁrmation biases entailed in purely manual
analytical and decision-making processes.

VI. CONCLUSION

Our study concluded that there is much work to achieve
before establishing a contextual and unambiguous cyber threat
intelligence ontology. Barriers to overcome include little fo-
cus on dedicated ontological cyber threat intelligence efforts
that can account for the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels; ambiguity in deﬁned concepts that prevents ontology
integration and adoption; extensive use of prose and limited
utilization of existing taxonomies that undermine the quer-
ability of the knowledge base and the ability to perform
reasoning; lack of relationships between concepts that can
support interpretation and explainability; and minimal use of
ontology axioms and constructs that can be used for semantic
consistency checking and information inference.

describes the relationship between them. The terminology used
is somewhat different than that of known taxonomies, and
their aim at modeling metrics is more prominent than that of
analysis and reasoning. The ontology is published on GitHub3.
The Uniﬁed Cybersecurity Ontology was suggested by Syed
et al. [34] in 2016. It serves as a backbone for linking cyber
security and other relevant ontologies. There are mappings
to aspects of STIX, and references to CVE, CCE, CVSS,
CAPEC, STUCCO and KillChain. The concepts are loosely
connected at a very high level and the lack of OWL con-
structs decreases the reasoning capabilities of the ontology.
In addition, our analysis indicate that the use of domain and
range restrictions would result in faulty classiﬁcations when
used with a reasoner. The ontology is published on GitHub4.
The Uniﬁed Cyber Ontology has been introduced on
GitHub5, without any academic publications to date and no
actual RDF/OWL ﬁles yet. The model ontology is however
interesting as it originates from the creators of STIX, which is
currently the most used format for sharing threat intelligence
[16]. The content of that work is driven primarily by the initial
base requirements of expressing cyber investigation informa-
tion and is the product of input from the Cyber-investigation
Analysis Standard Expression community (CASE)6.

Without any publication, we ﬁnd the Cyber Intelligence On-
tology (CIO), published only on GitHub7 to be relevant. This
GitHub repository includes most of the mentioned taxonomies
and sharing standards in this article, encoded in OWL. The
limitation of those ontologies is that they are not connected
or uniﬁed. For the aforementioned reason, we do not include
CIO in the analysis and the evaluation table.

V. DISCUSSION

Intelligence-driven defense augments organizations’ detect-
ing and responding capabilities and introduces a more in-
formed preventive approach to the overall cybersecurity op-
erations. The maturity, the analytical skills, and the available
information sources of a security team determine their capa-
bility to produce accurate and actionable threat intelligence
[35] [36].

To leverage the beneﬁts of ontologies and description logics
in cyber threat intelligence, we need unambiguous representa-
tions with sufﬁcient expressivity and robust explicable bind-
ings between concepts. A reference architecture like the one
provided by our Cyber Threat Intelligence model can be used
as an engineering blueprint that can support the fundamental
development of concepts through modular domain ontologies
that can be the basis for establishing a bigger and more
comprehensive ontology that is extensible and adaptive. The
analysis of the existing ontological efforts conﬁrmed that there
is still a small focus and much work to be done to establish
