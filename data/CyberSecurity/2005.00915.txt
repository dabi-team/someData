Abstract

The integration of sensors and communication technology in power systems,

known as the smart grid, is an emerging topic in science and technology. One

of the critical issues in the smart grid is its increased vulnerability to cyber

threats. As such, various types of threats and defense mechanisms are proposed

in literature. This paper oﬀers a bibliometric survey of research papers focused

on the security aspects of Internet of Things (IoT) aided smart grids. To the

best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the very ﬁrst bibliometric survey paper in

this speciﬁc ﬁeld. A bibliometric analysis of all journal articles is performed and

the ﬁndings are sorted by dates, authorship, and key concepts. Furthermore,

this paper also summarizes the types of cyber threats facing the smart grid, the

various security mechanisms proposed in literature, as well as the research gaps

in the ﬁeld of smart grid security.

1. Introduction

The smart grid is becoming the power systems of the next generation [1]. The

development of todays power systems is aimed towards integrating smart meters,

sensors, and advanced computing technologies [2]. This smart grid technology

greatly enhances the power generation eﬃciency and prompts the incorporation

of various sources of energy generation into one system [3]. The association

of smart meters and sensors along power grid networks allows the generation

centers access to real-time power demand information. This information can be

used to implement an eﬃcient generation and distribution plan [4, 5]. As such,

integration of these technologies into power system infrastructure has greatly

increased the energy eﬃciency as well as reduced the price of electricity.

Several countries are investing in smart grid technologies due to its poten-

tial for great economic and social beneﬁts [6]. However, utilizing communication

networks induces security risks and vulnerability to cyber attacks. Therefore,

cybersecurity and detection of cyber attacks is an essential part of smart grid

movement. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the

Energy Expert Cyber Security Platform (EESCP), and the European Commis-

sion’s Smart Grids Task Force have all highlighted the importance of cybersecu-

rity in the emerging smart grid technologies [7, 8, 9]. As a result, many studies

have been published that propose cybersecurity methods and cyber attack iden-

tiﬁcation.

Smart grid systems consist of various resources and technologies [10]. Smart

meters are incorporated to collect consumption data for more eﬃcient power

distribution. Additionally, interconnection of supervisory control and data ac-

quisition (SCADA) allows for more expanded centralized distribution along large

geographical areas [11]. The smart grid also allows for interaction among trans-

mission and distribution grids, building controllers, as well as various sources

of energy generation [12, 13]. However, the integration of digital and informa-

tion technology into the smart grid and the increased complexity of the system

increases the possibility of cyber attacks and failures propagating from one sys-

2

tem to another [14]. As such, there are many challenges accompanying cyber-

security in the smart grid. Some examples include the diﬃculty modelling the

non-linearities and stochasticity of the system, as well as modeling the various

types of cyber attacks that can potentially inﬂict the system.

Many Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors and hacking teams are tar-

geting critical infrastructure and services [15] ranging from healthcare [16] and

safety critical systems [17] to the smart grid. Furthermore, the rise of Internet of

Things (IoT) technology which can be deﬁned as a network of physical devices

connected to the internet. The use of such devices can help the smart grid by

supporting various network functions in power generation and storage as well

as provide connectivity between supplier and consumers [18]. The integration

of IoT devices in the smart grid also poses additional vulnerabilities to cyber

threats [19].

Various methods for cyber attack detection have been proposed in litera-

ture. Model based solutions, such as variants of state estimation techniques and

statistical-based models, have been suggested [20, 21]. Furthermore, the use of

Kalman ﬁlters for measurement estimation has been proposed to detect cyber

attacks [22, 23]. Alternatively, intelligent systems have also been proposed in

literature. The use of supervised learning was proposed for detection of false

data injection (FDI) attacks [24, 25]. While supervised machine learning tech-

niques oﬀer higher accuracy [26], semi-supervised machine learning techniques

may rely on lesser studied features such as spatial and temporal correlation of

smart meter measurements [27].

Other machine learning based solutions have been proposed including rein-

forcement learning and deep learning algorithms. The use of Artiﬁcial Immune

Systems (AIS) coupled with an SVM to detect malicious data was proposed in

[28]. Alternatively, the use of deep learning to extract the nonlinear features

in electric load data to improve on an interval state estimation-based defense

system is also proposed in [29]. Deep learning is also implemented in real-time

detection of false data injection attacks in [30]. Additionally, deep learning is

used to analyze real time measurements from PMUs for cyber attack mitigation

3

in [31]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are also proposed for detection of

cyber attacks by observing temporal variations in successive historical data in

[32]. Furthermore, unsupervised deep learning is also used to propose a scalable

intelligent attack detection solution in [33].

Many Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors and hacking teams are tar-

geting critical infrastructure and services [15] ranging from healthcare [16]and

safety critical systems [17] to the smart grid.

The variety in and complexity of cyber threats in the smart grid provoked

a large amount of solutions. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis and summary

of the up to date solutions to smart grid cybersecurity is important. Such

analysis is also lacking in literature. Several summaries and literature reviews

have already been published on the topic. For example, literature review and

a survey on smart grid cybersecurity was given in [34] and[35]. Similarly, a

systematic mapping study of cyber-physical systems has also been published

in [36]. However, these reviews have all been published before 2016 and, as

such, are outdated and do not include many of the new solutions proposed.

More recent literature reviews have been published which analyze the various

types of cyber threats in the smart grid through a survey of literature [37,

38]. Both articles, however, lack a bibliometric analysis of literature as well

as an inquiry of the attack detection methods used. There are also surveys

of smart grid cybersecurity articles [39, 40]; both of which have emphasized

cybersecurity standards and lack details regarding types of cyber attacks and

defense mechanisms.

The purpose of this paper is to identify, classify, and review existing publi-

cations on cybersecurity of the smart grid to better understand current security

mechanisms in literature. A bibliometric analysis is performed on related ar-

ticles to date, to categorize the publications by its bibliometric characteristics

such as authors and dates. This bibliometric analysis can allow researchers to

better understand the state of the art of the cybersecurity systems implemented

in the smart grid as well as the structure and characteristics of studies in this

ﬁeld. Understanding patterns in research activities can improve future work

4

and research in the ﬁeld of smart grid cybersecurity. To perform a successful

bibliometric evaluation, this paper aims to investigate journal articles published

between January 2010 and May 2019 in the domain of cybersecurity in the smart

grid. The paper will consider the following research questions:

a) What is the trend of publications in smart grid cybersecurity?

b) What is the future direction of cybersecurity in the smart grid?

c) What are the types of cyber threats currently studied?

d) What are the defence mechanisms used in IoT integrated the smart grid?

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the

research methods used for the bibliometric analysis. Section 3 demonstrates the

resultant ﬁndings. Next, Section 4 discusses the attacks on power systems that

have been reported. Section 5 provides classiﬁcation of cyber attack detection

in the smart grid. Finally, Section 6 is the conclusion of this study and describes

the challenges and future trends of smart grid cybersecurity.

2. Methodology

The methods used in this paper follow a similar process to [41], which di-

vides the bibliometric methods into two parts. First, general instructions, which

discusses the search methods and search engines used to ﬁnd papers and elim-

inate possible sources of error. Next, publication analysis, which discusses the

evaluation of the publications. This method of bibliometric analysis is used in

various subjects, such as the rise of malware in the cybersecurity domain [41],

the expansion of scientiﬁc literature on women in science and higher education

[42], and literature trends in the domain of biomass energy [43]. Since this bib-

liometric method is widely used in various subjects of literature, this paper will

follow the same methodology and apply it to the domain of cybersecurity in the

smart grid.

Online research databases are used to retrieve all the relevant journal arti-

cles from January 2010 to May 2019. There are various online databases that

5

include papers in this domain. IEEE Explore and ScienceDirect are two of the

largest databases for smart grid related publications [36]. The Web of Science

(WoS) database is also commonly used since it includes publications from vari-

ous international databases [41]. The three aforementioned databases are used

with the following search query, which was chosen based on survey papers in

this ﬁeld [37, 38, 39, 40]:

(”Smart Grid” AND ”Cyber Security” OR ”Cyber Attack” OR ”Cyber

Threat” OR ”False Data Injection” OR ”Attack Detection”)

Results from all databases are cross-referenced for repeated results. The

results are ﬁltered based on their relevance to cybersecurity of the smart grid,

which is evaluated based on the abstracts of the papers. The papers excluded

from the bibliometric analysis include papers written in any language other than

English, and papers that contain the speciﬁed keywords but are not relevant to

smart grid cybersecurity. The included papers are categorized according to

timeline, journals, and authors. The papers are also categorized based on the

research output, which will be mainly measured by the frequency of key words

and phrases. Software such as Zotero and VOSviewer tool are used to sort and

visualize the bibliometric data.

3. Findings

This section discusses the ﬁndings of the bibliometric analysis on the topic

of security systems in the smart grid. Using the search query speciﬁed in the

Section 2, the three databases found a total of 2314 search results for journal

articles. After ﬁltering duplicates, 1722 journal articles remained. Figure 1

shows that the largest number of journal articles on this topic are in the WoS

database which account for 61.2% of the ﬁndings. ScienceDirect and IEEE

Xplore databases have fewer results accounting for 30.1% and 8.67% respec-

tively. Furthermore, duplicates among the three databases accounted for 25.6%

which indicates that while some papers are mentioned in multiple databases, the

use of only one database is not a suﬃcient tool to represent the state-of-the-art

6

in this topic.

Figure 1: Percentage of journal articles published in each database on the topic of security

systems in the smart grid

After ﬁltering duplicates, the 1722 journal articles are sorted by year of

publication as seen in Figure 2. The ﬁgure demonstrates the novelty of the

subject of security systems in the smart grid. Moreover, the majority of the

articles were published in the last 5 years; 30.2% of the journal articles were

published in 2018, 20.1% were published in 2017, 12.1% in 2016, and 8.2%

and 11.6% were published in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Furthermore, the

upward trend in publications over time demonstrates substantial growth in this

research topic. Additionally, the small number of publications prior to 2010 show

that security systems in the smart grid is a ﬁeld of study that only recently

commenced; meaning that there are likely several uncertainties and much to

explore in this research ﬁeld.

To study the contributions of diﬀerent journals to the topic of security sys-

tems in the smart grid, the articles are sorted by journal of publication. Table

1 shows the 40 most prominent journals in this research ﬁeld, sorted by number

of publications. These results demonstrate that while some journals hold more

publications in this ﬁeld than others, the research papers are spread out among

7

Figure 2: Number of journal articles on security systems of the smart grid published every

year

a large number of journals. The wide distribution of articles among journals

proves that this research area is of general importance to science and society

and many journals seek publications in this topic.

To explore the speciﬁc aspects of smart grid cybersecurity, a keyword analysis

was performed. The heat-map in Figure 3 shows the most prominent keywords

observed in the articles analyzed. This heat-map represents the keywords in

colored clusters as well as their connections. Figure 3 exhibits the most signif-

icant topics in this subject based on their occurrence in journal papers. This

heatmap shows the most important terms surrounding smart grid security which

11

demonstrates the main concepts associated with this research ﬁeld.

The ﬁndings of this bibliometric analysis demonstrate the signiﬁcance of

security in the smart grid. The number of contributing authors and journals

show an active community of researchers focused on this topic. Additionally,

the increasing number of publications in recent years shows a great increase in

the interest of this topic. To further demonstrate the signiﬁcance of security in

the smart grid, the next section discusses reported attacks on power systems in

recent history as well as their impact.

12

4. Reported Attacks on the Smart Grid

There have been several documented attacks on the electric grid attributed

to cyber attacks. In January 2003, the computer network at the Davis-Besse

nuclear plant in Oak Harbor, Ohio was compromised by a malware disabling its

processing computer and safety monitoring system for several hours [44]. Simi-

larly, circulation pumps at the Brown Ferry nuclear plant in Alabama failed due

to excessive traﬃc, believed to be attributed to a DoS attack [44]. Furthermore,

an investigation in 2009 revealed that hackers are able to steal power through

compromising the smart meters and changing the consumption readings [45].

Phishing incidents have also been reported at electric bulk providers and mal-

ware samples were found indicating a targeted and sophisticated intrusion [44].

Additionally, in April of 2012, the FBI was asked to investigate widespread in-

cidents of power thefts through smart meter attacks [45]. The report indicates

that hackers changed the power consumption of smart meters using software

available easily on the internet.

Such incidents in recent history induce various security concerns regarding

critical infrastructure. As such, it is crucial that security of the smart grid is

explored at every level including adequate situational awareness at all times. In

fact, lack of situational awareness can have devastating impacts beyond cyber

threats. For example, in August of 2003, a blackout occurred in the north east

of the United States due to a cascading failure of the power system due to

the lack of awareness of the Ohio-based electric utility company. This lack of

awareness resulted in a cascading failure of 508 generators and 265 power plants

across eight states and southern Ontario [45]. This clearly shows how adequate

security systems can have beneﬁts beyond mitigating cyber threats, including

minimizing damage from faults or incidents.

5. Security Systems in the Smart Grid

This section examines the security threats facing the smart grid, as well as

the state of the art of the current countermeasures of these threats. Subsection

13

Figure 4: The number of journal articles studying each attack type

5.1 discusses the speciﬁc types of cyber threats in power systems, and subsection

5.2 discusses the defense mechanisms proposed in literature.

5.1. Types of Cyber Threats

Cyber threats or cyber attacks are among the most discussed and studied

threats for the smart grid [37]. The wide interest in studying cyber threats in

the smart grid is due to the number of signiﬁcant vulnerabilities identiﬁed [46].

Furthermore, cyber attacks have the potential of leading power systems into

total collapse [47]. These cyber attacks can occur for various purposes and are

generally divided into two main types: Passive Attacks and Active Attacks [48].

Passive attacks include eavesdropping, spying, and traﬃc analysis; while active

attacks include denial of service (DoS) and malware attacks.

The various types of attacks are not equally studied in literature. Figure 4

shows the number of articles studying each type of attack. While there are more

14

types of cyber threats that can compromise a network, the following sections

discuss the attacks studied in the smart grid, which are mentioned in Figure 4.

5.1.1. Spooﬁng Attacks

The main types of spooﬁng are GPS spooﬁng, ARP spooﬁng, and IP spoof-

ing [49]. IP spooﬁng uses a modiﬁed IP to pass through security systems and

is typically the ﬁrst stage of a complex intrusion. GPS spooﬁng, however, is

based on broadcasting incorrect signals of higher strength than received from

satellites to deceive victims. ARP spooﬁng is where falsiﬁed ARP (Address

Resolution Protocol) messages are used to link the attackers MAC address with

the IP address of the victim. Through this all data in the compromised system

will pass through the intruder. The most common type of spooﬁng attacks in

the smart grid is GPS spooﬁng due to the use of GPS receivers in the meter-

ing infrastructure. Vulnerability analysis in literature demonstrates how phasor

measurement units (PMUs) are susceptible to GPS spooﬁng attacks [50]. GPS

spooﬁng attacks can mislead the network operator, and drastically impact sub-

sequent corrective control actions [51].

5.1.2. Replay Attacks

Replay attacks aim to intercept authentication information. In the smart

grid, replay attacks intercept the usage pattern along the varying smart meters

and replay this data to carry out an undetected intrusion [52]. The integration

of IoT devices in smart grid networks induces increased threat to these attacks.

Furthermore, attacker can inject incorrect data to the system, which may lead

to incorrect energy price or inaccurate prediction [53].

5.1.3. Man-in-the-Middle Attack

This attack makes use of ARP, which maps a protocol address to a hardware

address (MAC address) [54]. The purpose of this attack is to combine the

attackers MAC address with the hosts IP address triggering any traﬃc meant

for that particular IP to be sent to the attacker instead, this is referred to as

15

ARP spooﬁng [55]. This allows the attacker to capture the communication

information within the SCADA system [56].

5.1.4. Smart Meter DoS Attacks

DoS attacks are typically achieved by ﬂooding speciﬁc nodes of the system

with data that prompts generating and sending large volume of reply and request

packets [57]. There are various methods for generating such attacks which can

cause a system blackout [58]. These attacks can also be implemented through

IoT devices integrated into the smart grid. The increased integration of these

IoT devices has led to increased interest in DoS attacks [59].

5.1.5. Malware

The propagation of malicious software, known as malware, is another poten-

tial cyber threat to the smart grid [60]. One paper tests security methods for

three diﬀerent types of malware, pandemic malware, endemic malware, and con-

tagion malware [61]. Pandemic malware is an aggressive malware that infects

all devices in the shortest time possible through a topological scan strategy. En-

demic malware, however, is the more intelligent type which sacriﬁces speed for

stealth by operating with less conspicuous hit list. Finally, contagion malware

is highly stealth and does not initiate connections with the network but rather

appends on legitimate communication ﬂows.

The dangers of malware are accentuated in the communication layer of the

smart grid.

It has been noted that thousands of smart meters may feature

identical hardware and ﬁrmware [62]. While this reduces cost and automates

maintenance, the closeness in device types and software induces susceptibility

to malware propagation.

5.1.6. False Data Injection Attacks

False Data Injection (FDI) attacks consist of malicious data injected into

measurement meters [63]. FDI attacks can be performed by manipulating the

measurements along the network by a linear factor of the Jacobian matrix of

the power system [25, 64]. This change in measurement is undetected by the

16

current state estimation techniques [65]. Furthermore, these attacks can be

created in various strategies with limited knowledge of power system topology

[66, 67, 68]. As such, these types of attacks are widely studied in the smart grid

cybersecurity ﬁeld [63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75].

5.1.7. Micro-Grid-Based Jamming Attack

This type of attack consists of jamming speciﬁc signal channels to intervene

and disrupt data transmission [76]. This results in unreliable communications

and decreased performance in the power system [77, 10].

5.2. Defence Mechanisms

Security and defense against the aforementioned attacks and threats is achieved

through various mechanisms. The security measures proposed in literature are

divided into the “7D model” or the 7 phases of cybersecurity as given in [78]:

• discovery

• detection

• denial

• disruption

• degradation

• destruction

The following subsections of Subsection 5.2 will discuss each of the compo-

nents and their proposed methods in literature.

5.2.1. Discovery

The discovery process in cybersecurity involves identifying and locating sen-

sitive data for adequate protection.

In general applications of cybersecurity,

data discovery consists of auditing regulated information to ensure its protec-

tion. This is helpful because it enables context aware security, in which infor-

mation within the system is protected based on its sensitivity. In smart grid

17

security, the discovery phase mainly consists of identiﬁcation of vulnerabilities

within the system.

Various methods are proposed in literature for vulnerability analysis in power

grids. One paper proposes an automated binary-based vulnerability discovery

method that extracts security-related features from the system [79]. This au-

tomatic discovery algorithm is tested on real smart meter data from Korean

infrastructure. Vulnerability analysis speciﬁc to certain types of environments

or threats are also proposed. In another paper, the survivability of smart grid

under is modeled under random and targeted attacks considering a networking

islanding scheme [80]. Another paper uses automatic static analysis (ASA) to

detect buﬀer-overﬂow vulnerabilities of terminal devices [81]. Such automated

techniques for vulnerability analysis can be useful due to their robustness and

scalability to larger systems. As such, a comprehensive assessment of vulner-

abilities in the smart grid from past to future has been published highlighting

the various vulnerabilities and discovery techniques [82].

More speciﬁc vulnerability modeling is also proposed in literature. One such

work models the vulnerabilities of the smart grid with incomplete topology in-

formation [83]. The results of this paper demonstrate the high level of threat in

the smart grid by exhibiting vulnerabilities that can be exploited with limited

knowledge of the system. Another paper reveals the cascading failure vulnera-

bility in the smart grid using a novel metric, called risk graph, which shows the

importance of nodes within the system as well as the relationship among them

[84]. Using this method, Zhu et al. develop a new node attack strategy and

introduce new vulnerabilities not considered before in literature.

Vulnerability analyses are also performed on speciﬁc attacks. One paper

performs a vulnerability analysis of the smart grid to GPS spooﬁng, a type

of attack capable of altering measurements to mislead network operators [50].

Another paper analyzes the vulnerability for simultaneous attacks in the smart

grid [85]. Paul and Ni consider various combinations of attacks and proposes a

new damage measurement matrix to quantify the loss of generation power and

time to reach steady-state. Web-based threats are also considered in another

18

paper which tackles the penetration of digital devices in the smart grid and the

associated consequences [86].

Most articles assess the vulnerability of the smart grid by analyzing either

substations or transmission lines. One article, however, performs a vulnera-

bility assessment on a joint substation and transmission line system in which

attacks can happen in either the substation, the transmission line, or both [87].

Another article takes into account scenarios of severe emergencies in the smart

grid and SCADA network and performs a vulnerability analysis of the system

under emergencies such as attacks from weapons of mass destruction (WMD)

[88]. Chopade and Bikdash analyze structural vulnerabilities, which consider in-

frastructures topology, and functional vulnerabilities, which consider operating

regimes of diﬀerent infrastructures.

As demonstrated by the aforementioned articles, there is suﬃcient analysis

on vulnerabilities in the smart grid. Various attack strategies are identiﬁed

and implemented in literature that demonstrate the potential of cyber threats.

Detection and mitigation of some of these threats remains as a gap in this

research ﬁeld. Next, we discuss the detection mechanisms proposed as well as

the future trend in these methods.

5.2.2. Detection of Attacks

Detection of cyber threats is typically achieved through classiﬁcation using

data or measurements across the power system. Measurements along various

infrastructure and communication layers of the system are used to detect the

presence of threats or attacks. Model-based techniques are used to detect cyber

attacks through meter measurements through enhanced state-estimation tech-

niques [20, 89, 90]. Furthermore, distributed algorithms are used to ﬁnd sta-

tistical variations in cyber attack vectors [22]. Kalman ﬁlters are also used to

estimate measurements along the power system along with statistical methods

of ﬁnding anomalies in measurements [22, 23, 91].

For defense methods to be scalable to larger systems, purely model-based at-

tack detection techniques are insuﬃcient to guarantee the security of the smart

19

grid [92, 25]. As such, the use of intelligent systems and machine learning for

detecting cyber attacks is proposed. Supervised and unsupervised learning have

been tested and compared to conclude that supervised learning approaches gen-

erally result in more accurate classiﬁcation of attacks [93]. Various supervised

learning algorithms have been successfully implemented [94, 95]. The results of

comparing these learning algorithms demonstrate that a Gaussian-based Sup-

port Vector Machine (SVM) is more robust with more accurate classiﬁcation

among larger test systems [95]. Furthermore, another paper implemented the

margin setting algorithm (MSA) demonstrating better results than SVM and

artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) [96, 25]. Other intelligent techniques include

adaboost, random forests, and common path mining method [97, 98, 99].

A critical concern in the use of intelligent systems in smart grid is computa-

tional eﬃciency [100, 101]. Many researchers try to tackle this issue by reducing

the dimensions of the data through principal component analysis [93, 94]. One

paper proposes the use of a genetic algorithm to select an ideal subset of fea-

tures that can increase the computation speed while maintaining the detection

accuracy of the machine learning algorithms [102]. Exploring various feature

selection techniques can be eﬀective at increasing the computational eﬃciency

of machine learning algorithms. However, there have not been many papers

exploring this subject in the area of smart grid cybersecurity. As such, deep

learning techniques with automated or unsupervised feature selection methods

are likely to be proposed to tackle the computational burden of larger power

systems.

5.2.3. Denial of Attacks

One of the security methods in the smart grid revolves around the denial

or prevention of cyber threats. Denial techniques pertaining the security of the

smart grid typically take the shape of encryption methods for secure commu-

nications within the system [77, 103]. The most common encryption methods

are the use of symmetric or asymmetric keys. Symmetric keys use the same key

to encrypt and decrypt the messages while asymmetric keys use diﬀerent keys

20

for encryption and decryption [10, 104]. Asymmetric key encryption requires

a larger computational capacity and is therefore not suitable for time-sensitive

information. Symmetric key encryption does not induce signiﬁcant computa-

tional delay. However, it requires a public infrastructure for key management.

Therefore, it is suitable for encryption of distribution and transmission systems

[105, 106, 107].

Various encryption and key management methods have been proposed. One

scheme is based on Needham-Shroeder authentication protocol and elliptic curve

cryptographic algorithms for generating public keys [108]. Another scheme uses

digital certiﬁcates to establish symmetric communication sessions [105]. Ad-

ditionally, another authentication method is proposed that is based on S/key

one-time password scheme aimed to provide mutual authentication between the

meters and servers of the smart grid [109]. Mutual authentication between

smart grid utility network and Home Area Network (HAN) smart meters is

also explored through a novel key management protocol [110]. The proposed

mechanism aims at preventing various attacks including Brute-force, Replay,

Man-in-The-Middle, and Denial-of-Service attacks. Furthermore, encryption of

speciﬁc variables and measurements is also studied, speciﬁcally pertaining to

FDI attacks [111, 112, 112].

Choosing appropriate key management schemes is done by considering the

trade-oﬀ between security and computational eﬃciency. However, other issues

pertaining denial of attacks arise from the distributed nature of smart grid sys-

tems. One paper proposes an eﬃcient framework to read isolated smart grid de-

vices that satisﬁes the hardware constraints while maintaining integrity against

most typical attacks [113]. Another protocol is proposed for preserving privacy

through aggregation of metering data in distributed scenarios and encryption

of measurements using a secret sharing scheme [114].

Other denial techniques are proposed in literature include increasing situa-

tional awareness to prevent attacks. One paper proposes speciﬁc measures to

tackle issues that lead to lack of awareness among smart grid operators. Such

measures include separate networks for actuators and sensors and restricting the

21

use of real time clocks to write-only data storage [115]. Another paper proposes

a diﬀerent proactive defense approach which consists of randomizing meter in-

frastructure conﬁgurations to lower the predictability of the system to potential

adversaries [116]. While there are many approaches to deny or prevent cyber

threats, further research is likely necessary due to the continuous improvement

and modiﬁcations of adversarial techniques.

5.2.4. Disruption of Attacks

A critical part of the security of any system is the disruption of cyber threats

once the system is infected. Disruption of attacks in the smart grid is typically

tackled by game theory approaches. One paper demonstrates disruptive coun-

termeasures to reduce the impact of attacks based on the knowledge of non-

compromised components [117]. Similarly, another paper demonstrates how

informed decisions can be made in real-world scenario of attacks to mitigate or

disrupt them [118]. This is done by using a sequential two-player game model

that includes attacker/defender behavior. Similarly, another article attempts

to achieve the same goal by making use of the Stackelberg competition, which

quantitatively analyzes the game process between attacker and operator [119].

A linear game framework is also proposed with the emphasis on application to

large power systems with large number of components under attack [120].

Disruption of attacks through game theory is also studied under varying

circumstances. One article considers coalitional attacks that can be launched

by multiple adversaries [121]. A game-theoretic model is proposed to capture

the interaction among the adversaries and quantify the capacity of the defender

based on Iterated Public Goods Game (IPGG) model. Similarly, stochastic

games for protection against coordinated attacks is also proposed in [122]. This

method uses an optimal load shedding technique to quantify physical impacts

of coordinated attacks which are used as input parameters to model interac-

tions between attacker and defender. Another paper looks into speciﬁc types

of attacks that exploit cyber vulnerabilities of speciﬁc meters and spread into

the physical components of the system [123]. This paper also proposes game

22

theory to analyze such attacks. Similarly, a game-theoretic perspective of data

injection attacks with multiple adversaries is also studied [124].

There is also focus on the disruption of speciﬁc common attacks in the smart

grid. Game theory based defense strategies against DoS attacks are proposed

which use Nash Equilibrium to maintain dynamic stability in an attacked system

[125, 126]. Minimizing the eﬀects of jamming attacks is also studied through a

modiﬁed version of contract network protocol (CNP) as a negotiation protocol

among agents [127]. Results of this paper indicate that applying the proposed

protocol can reduce the jammers illegal proﬁt and decrease their motive. The

problem with most of the proposed game theory techniques, however, is their

tendency to view network interdictions as one-time events. Further research in

this topic is likely to take shape as more comprehensive modeling of network

interdictions occurs. There are few papers in literature that take this into

consideration. One paper, however, uses zero-sum Markov games and a more

comprehensive model of attacker behavior [128]. This paper also demonstrates

a defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Next, we discuss the

deception techniques proposed in literature, which when combined with the

aforementioned disruption techniques, can act as a comprehensive strategy for

mitigating attacks.

5.2.5. Deception of Attackers

While disruption of attacks involves minimizing the damage of cyber attacks,

deception focuses on altering the direction of the attack to mitigate its impact.

This is done by deceiving the attacker into targeting a trap. This deception

technology is an emerging ﬁeld in cyber security due to its potential to detect

and defend against zero-day and advanced attacks. In the security of the smart

grid, however, deception technology is seldom used in literature.

A strategic honeypot game model was proposed for DoS attacks in the smart

grid [129]. This paper introduces honeypots into the metering infrastructure net-

work as a decoy system to detect and gather information. Interactions between

attackers and defenders are analyzed and the existence of several Bayesian-Nash

23

equilibriums is proved. However, this method was designed and tested for one

speciﬁc type of attack. A more general honeypot system is proposed to emulate

an entire smart grid ﬁeld communication infrastructure in [130]. This paper

claims that their honeynet system can emulate high-ﬁdelity and realistic power

grid behavior to deceive the attackers. However, evaluation of its realism and

scalability are only preliminary and testing was done on a single simulated sys-

tem. Another paper identiﬁes the various types of honeypots and built a test

system to emulate a device on a utility network [131]. However, similarly to

the aforementioned papers, analysis regarding realism and scalability are insuf-

ﬁcient. This is identiﬁed as a research gap in the deception strategies for smart

grid security. Future research is expected to involve more comprehensive system

modeling and the proposal of more versatile honeynet systems.

5.2.6. Degradation or Destruction of Attacks

Degrading or destroying the attack is the ﬁnal part of the defense strat-

egy in the smart grid and it involves minimizing or destroying the eﬀects of

the attack. An example of such mitigation techniques include deﬁning security

metrics that quantify the importance of individual substations [132]. Another

proposed method uses a distinctive modeling technique with the capability to

modify network topology [133]. Such a technique can be used to degrade the

attack through optimizing the operation of the power system to minimize its

eﬀects. This is done through a mixed-integer nonlinear bi-level program; in the

upper-level a terrorist agent maximizes the damage caused in the power sys-

tem, and in the lower level the system operator minimizes the damage through

optimal operation of the power system. Furthermore, the paper proposes a

Benders decomposition approach to transform the problem into a standard one-

level optimization problem. Another paper, however, tackles the same problem

through a genetic algorithm [134]. Alternatively, another paper proposes a dif-

ferent tri-level model for power network defense with the same goal of minimizing

economic cost that the attacks may cause [135].

Degradation techniques are often coupled with disruption techniques in game

24

theory approaches, as mentioned in Subsection 5.2.4. As such, defense solutions

that only focus on degradation of attacks are limited. Furthermore, due to the

legal implications, there are no solutions proposed that focus on destroying the

attack through hostile actions towards the adversary. Therefore, most solutions

in literature focus on denying, detecting, and minimizing the eﬀect of attacks.

6. Conclusion

This paper analyzes publications within the ﬁeld of security of IoT-aided

smart grids. Bibliometric results are reported highlighting the signiﬁcance and

growth of this ﬁeld. The ﬁndings demonstrate exponential growth in the ﬁeld of

security systems in the smart grid over the last decade. Furthermore, the journal

papers analyzed discuss a variety of issues and various types of solutions. The

ﬁndings are summarized and types of threats, security measures, and evaluation

methods of the security systems are discussed. This bibliometric analysis con-

cludes that the variety of threats and the complexity of smart grid systems calls

for comprehensive and intelligent security methods. Furthermore, the primary

concerns in detection of cyber threats are computational eﬃciency and mini-

mizing the rate of false positives. Therefore, future publications are expected

to take aim at increasing the computational speed of security algorithms while

maintaining a high detection accuracy and a low rate of false alarms. Another

research gap in this ﬁeld is the mitigation of cyber threats that have already

infected a smart grid. Most papers focus on detection and prevention of cyber

threats and only a few papers focus on mitigating those threats. Therefore,

future trends in this ﬁeld of study are projected towards the mitigation of cyber

threats as well as robust deep learning algorithms for eﬃcient detection of cyber

threats.
