ABSTRACT
Anomaly event detection is crucial for critical infrastructure se-
curity(transportation system, social-ecological sector, insurance
service, government sector etc.) due to its ability to reveal and
address the potential cyber-threats in advance by analysing the
data(messages, microblogs, logs etc.) from digital systems and net-
works. However, the convenience and applicability of smart devices
and the maturity of connected technology make the social anomaly
events data multi-source and dynamic, which result in the inadapt-
ability for multi-source data detection and thus affect the critical in-
frastructure security. To effectively address the proposed problems,
in this paper, we design a novel anomaly detection method based on
multi-source data. First, we leverage spectral clustering algorithm
for feature extraction and fusion of multiple data sources. Second,
by harnessing the power of deep graph neural network(Deep-GNN),
we perform a fine-gained anomaly social event detection, revealing
the threatening events and guarantee the critical infrastructure
security. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
outperforms other baseline anomaly event detection methods and
shows high tracking accuracy, strong robustness and stability.

1 INTRODUCTION
Secure critical infrastructure, such as transportation system, eco-
nomic sector, insurance service, government sector etc., is essential
for the functioning of a society and economy. As smart devices
and intelligent terminal advanced, critical infrastructures and their
security increasingly come to rely on embedded control systems
and external environment, especially social networks, which com-
bined with massive hidden information on potential security threats
[13, 32]. Due to the nature of events in social networks that is able
to indirectly reflect such latent problems, detecting social events
has become a research hotspot in data mining as well as security
field to solve the attacks in advance.

Social abnormal event is a phenomenon that exists in a large
number of social networks[15, 18, 21], and these abnormal event
contain a lot of hidden information related to reality; by in-depth
analysis and timely detection, it can realize effective management
of social environment. Effective and timely detection is considered
as an attractive method to discover the anomalies hidden or hot
topic in the complex and ever-changing of multi-source data world,
but there are many challenges to implement this approach; the chal-
lenges mainly include the variety of data types, the complex data
sources differentiation and dependence complexity in multi-source
data [6, 12]. From theory, since anomaly detection has important
theoretical and practical significance, they have an attractive re-
search field; From the reality, anomaly detection research is closely
related to our economic life and has great practical significance and
economic value.

Some model and method have been used in related field, and
gain a lot of useful results. The most frequently used the methods
and models of social anomaly detection include the followed sev-
eral types: utilizing similar distance calculation method, utilizing
similar density aggregation, clustering analytical method, high-
dimensional characteristic and graph network to realized anomaly
detection in multi-data source. In [3, 12], the paper considers the
idea of the anomaly detection based on similar distance analytical
method[14] is an hypothesis; the hypothesis is that the distance
between the abnormal samples and the normal samples is larger
than the distance from the normal sample to the data set; the anom-
aly degree is defined by the distance between the sample and other

 
 
 
 
 
 
objects in the data set, and the method needs set a distance hyper-
parameter and a ratio hyper-parameter to renew all the samples
in the data set after a process of filter operation. The disadvantage
of this method can only label binary samples in the data set and
cannot useful for samples of the multi-data source directly, and the
similar distance have major limitations[31].

Cluster-based method is a machine learning technique that in-
volves grouping data points; the detailed description of the method
is that given a set of data points, clustering algorithms can be used
to divide each data point into a specific group[8]. In theory, data
points in the same group should have similar properties, and data
points in different groups should have highly different attributes.
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DB-
SCAN) algorithm is an representative algorithm of anomaly detec-
tion methods based on clustering. However, the disadvantage of
the method based on density is that the effectiveness of the model.
The type of algorithm is heavily dependent on the effectively char-
acterize the clustering structure of the specified data set, and the
generality of the algorithm is ignored.

With the popularity of intelligent communication equipment and
the development of mobile Internet technology, social networking
is becoming a tool that people use frequently; it forms a very large
digital world of social behavior, and there are complex dependen-
cies and correlation between the data of the diverse sources. The
abnormal events of the social network can reflect the real emotions
and opinions of network users, and becomes one of the important
goal of big data mining in the network information space. The
primary task of event detection is how to accurately represent the
characteristics of social network data, and can timely detect and
analyze events in streaming online social data. Aforesaid method
can not be effectively applied to detect social anomaly events in
multi-source data, but graph structures can be accurately used
to represent the interdependencies between objects and to build
model. Graph-based anomaly detection methods have become the
attention of more and more researchers, especially in multi-source
data domain. Multi-source exception detection method has some
advantages, and the methods used samples between different data
sources to detect exceptions in a multi-source data set. In these
methods, the anomaly object was defined as if a sample is assigned
to different clusters in different data block. In literature [16], the
author considered the relationship between the sample in the spec-
ified data block and the possible clustering structures in that data
block, to obtain the final anomaly score for each sample.

Although existing methods of the social anomaly event have
produced great effect in multi-data source, with the continuous ex-
pansion of the application field and the increasing complexity of the
types of data sources, there remains some problem need to be solved
further such as the incremental representation of data, feature fu-
sion learning and emergency detection in multi-data source[19].
With the increasing of deep learning technology in social anomaly
event detection, the model and algorithm can bring new idea to
address the practical problem. Since the dynamics, diversity and
sparsity of social multi-data source cause difficult representation,
poor fusion learning of model and low efficiency of event detection
in multi-data source, the paper proposed a novel social anomaly
event detection, and the method uses spectral clustering to realized

feature extraction based on multi-data source, and uses deep graph
neural network to accomplish the social anomaly event detection.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: Sections II mainly
introduces the related work and algorithms, Sections III describes
the model designed. The results of the experiment are show in
Sections IV and the conclusion in Sections V.

2 RELATED WORKS AND ALGORITHMS
This section mainly reviews the related theories and introduces the
useful algorithms in our paper.

2.1 The Spectral Clustering
Spectral clustering is a widely used clustering algorithm, and by
comparing to the traditional k-means algorithm, spectral clustering
has stronger adaptability to realize data distribution, and has a
good clustering effect and low computation. Spectral clustering
is a clustering method based on graph theory, by clustering for
the eigenvectors of Laplace matrix of sample data to achieve the
purpose of sample data clustering. The spectral clustering algorithm
is simply described as

• N sample points is inputted 𝑋 = {𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑛 } and the

number of cluster clusters k; output clustering cluster 𝐴1, 𝐴2, . . . , 𝐴𝑘 .

• The similarity matrix W of 𝑛 ∗𝑛 is calculated as the following

formula:

𝑠𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑠 (𝑥𝑖, 𝑥 𝑗 ) =

𝑛
∑︁

𝑖=1,𝑗=1

𝑒𝑥𝑝

−∥𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑗 ∥2
2𝜎2

(1)

where W is similarity matrix of 𝑠𝑖 𝑗 .

• The degree matrix D is calculated as the following formula:

𝑑𝑖 =

𝑛
∑︁

𝑗=1

𝑤𝑖 𝑗

(2)

where D is the diagonal matrix of 𝑛 ∗ 𝑛;
• The Laplace matrix is calculated 𝐿 = 𝐷 − 𝑊 ;
• To calculate the eigenvalues of L, and sort the eigenvalues
from smallest to largest, and extract the first k eigenvalues,
and then calculate the eigenvectors of the first k eigenvalues
𝑢1, 𝑢2, . . . , 𝑢𝑘,;

• Take k of the above column vectors and form them into a

matrix 𝑈 = {𝑢1, 𝑢2, . . . , 𝑢𝑘 }, 𝑈 ∈ 𝑅𝑛∗𝑘 ;

• Assum 𝑦𝑖 ∈ 𝑅𝑘 is the 𝑖th row vectors of U, where 𝑖 =

1, 2, . . . , 𝑛;

• Use k-means algorithm to place new sample points 𝑌 =
{𝑦1, 𝑦2, . . . , 𝑦𝑛 to realize the cluster cluster 𝐶1, 𝐶2, . . . 𝐶𝐾 ;

• Output cluster 𝐴1, 𝐴2, . . . , 𝐴𝑘 , where, 𝐴𝑖 = { 𝑗 |𝑦 𝑗 ∈ 𝐶𝑖 }.

2.2 Typical Algorithms
According to the partition criterion used in the spectral clustering
algorithm, the algorithm can be divided into two-way spectral clus-
tering algorithm and multi-way spectral clustering algorithm[30].
The former uses two-way division criterion and the latter uses
K-way division criterion. Two-way spectral clustering algorithm
includes PF algorithm, SM algorithm, SLH algorithm, KVV algo-
rithm, and Mcut algorithm. PF algorithm proposes the eigenvectors
corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of the similarity matrix

𝑊 are used for clustering, and points out that for block diagonal
similarity matrices, the points corresponding to non-zero value of
eigenvectors belong to the same class, and the points corresponding
to zero value belong to another class[28]. SM algorithm points out
that the difference between NCUT and MNCUT lies only in the
spectral mapping used, and the eigenvector corresponding to the
second smallest eigenvalue, namely Fiedler vector, contains the
partition information of the graph, and according to the heuristic
rule, the partition point 𝑖 in this vector is found to minimize the
value of NCUT (A,B) obtained at this point, Finally, the value in
the vector is compared with the minimum value of NCUT criterion
function[22]. The points are greater than this value or equal to this
value, and the points belong to one class, and points are less than
this value belong to another class. The SLH algorithm reposition
algorithm calculates for the first 𝑘 feature vectors of the similarity
matrix 𝑊 , and the parameter 𝑘 needs to be specified in advance.
KVV algorithm, according to the heuristic rules, the division point
𝑖 in the Fiedler vector is found to minimize the RCUT (A,B) value
at this point, which is similar to the SM algorithm[4]. The only
difference is that the SM algorithm looks for the partition point
that minimizes the value of NCUT (A,B).

Multi-path spectral clustering algorithm includes NJW algorithm
and MS algorithm [11]. NJW algorithm, the eigenvectors corre-
sponding to the first 𝑘 maximum eigenvalues of the Laplace matrix
are selected to construct a new vector space 𝑅, and the correspond-
ing relationship with the original data is established in this new
space, and then the clustering is carried out[3]. In MS algorithm,
the first 𝑘 non-zero eigenvalues of the random walk matrix 𝑃 are
used to construct the matrix, and then the rows in the matrix are
treated as points in 𝑅 space for clustering. The steps are similar to
the NJW algorithm. The MS algorithm has achieved good results in
the actual image segmentation, but the clustering effect will be poor
if there is a big difference between the diagonal element values in
the degree matrix 𝐷[9].

2.3 Graph Neural Network
Recent years, graph neural network(GNN)has received more and
more attention in many research field, including social networking,
knowledge graphs, recommendation systems, etc.[20, 26]. The pow-
erful ability of GNN is to model the dependencies between nodes in
graphs, and has made breakthroughs in the research fields related
to graph analysis. A basic idea of graph neural network is that the
node is embedding based on its local neighbor information[17, 24].
GNN is a kind of neural network which acts directly on graph
structure. GNN has the following characteristics: the input order of
nodes are ignore; in the process of calculation, the representation
of a node is affected by its neighbor nodes, while the graph itself is
connected unchanged; The representation of graph structure en-
ables graph-based reasoning. Generally speaking, it is to aggregate
the information of each node and its surrounding nodes through a
neural network, Fig. 1 show the process of embedding:

Neural network is usually composed of two modules: propaga-
tion module and output module. Fig. 2 show the describes the basic
structure of neural network:

The symbols and meanings involved in the neural network struc-
ture as follow: 𝐺 = (𝑁 , 𝐸), N is the set of vertices, E is the set of

edges; 𝑛𝑒 [𝑛] is the adjacency vertex of vertex 𝑛; 𝑐𝑜 [𝑛] represents
the edge attached to the vertex n;𝑥𝑛 represents the characteristics of
vertex n; 𝑥𝑐𝑜 [𝑛] represents the characteristics of the edges attached
to the vertex n; ℎ𝑛𝑒 [𝑛] represents the embedded representation of
vertex n (state embedding); 𝑥𝑛𝑒 [𝑛] represents the characteristics of
adjacent nodes of vertex n; ℎ𝑛 is the embedded representation of
vertex n[2].

In propagation module of the GNN, the information is passed
between nodes, and the status is updated, where there include
aggregator and updater[5]. Aggregator: its purpose is to aggregate
the information of the nodes around the node 𝑛, and to learn the
embedding representation of node 𝑛, ℎ𝑛, and ℎ𝑛 is represented as
ℎ𝑛 = 𝑓 (𝑥𝑛, 𝑥𝑐𝑜 [𝑛], ℎ𝑛𝑒 [𝑛], 𝑥𝑛𝑒 [𝑛] )
where 𝑓 can be interpreted as a feedforward fully connected neural
network. Updater: the embedded representation of node 𝑁 in during
the learning process the model iteratively updates is the following
formula

(3)

𝐻 𝑡 +1 = 𝐹 (𝐻 𝑡 , 𝑋 )
(4)
where, 𝑡 is the iteration of 𝑡 th, 𝑋 is all the features, and 𝐻 𝑡 is the
embedded representation of all nodes in the 𝑡 th iteration.

The output module of the GNN can be divided into two forms
according to the different application types of the model:node-
focused and graph-focused[25]. For node-focused classification, the
label corresponding to each node after the last iteration is outputted
by the model,

𝑜𝑛 = 𝑔(ℎ𝑇

𝑛 , 𝑥𝑛)

(5)
where 𝑡𝑖 is the true label of the 𝑖th node, and 𝑜𝑖 is the model out-
put label, and 𝑝 is the number of the node. For the graph-focused
classification, the READOUT function is used to aggregate node
features from the last iteration, and to obtain the representation
vector ℎ(𝐺) of the entire graph.

ℎ(𝐺) = 𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑂𝑈𝑇 (ℎ𝐾

𝑣 |𝑣 ∈ 𝐺)

The READOUT function can be a simple permutation invariant

In this section, we mainly proposed an novel method of social
anomaly event detection based on multi-source data; the method
used spectral clustering algorithm to realize the feature space ex-
tension in multi-source data, and utilizes GNN model to achieve
the anomaly event detection. Fig. 3 shows the design process of
social anomaly detection based on multiple data sources.

Figure 3: Design process of social anomaly detection.

The processes of abnormal event detectionin this paper include

the below the steps shown:

• Data collection stage collect data samples related to the de-

tection requirements;

• Data pre-processing includes data denoising and dimension-

ality reduction;

• Model design, according to the detection requirements the
appropriate anomaly detection model is selected. Set the
necessary parameters for the model.

• Model training is carried out and use data pre-processing to
train model with supervised or unsupervised way, and this
is the key step.

• In model testing, the result of testing is acquired by anomaly

detection model with the test data set.

• Anomaly detection stage: the obtained model is used to de-

tect anomalies in the target data.

3.1 Feature Space Based on Spectral Clustering
In this paper, the data generated from different data sources are
analyze as a single view, and the multiple data are considered as
multiple view learning. Samples from different data sources have
different clustering forms, and the extended data set from multiple
sources data can be considered that a description of the same prob-
lem from different angles[10]. In multiple source data sets, anomaly
event is redefined as the sample is of inconsistent behavior in differ-
ent data source , and the anomaly event of multiple view learning is
defined as the sample belongs to the different clustering structure
formed in different view spare learning[23].

We propose a consistent multi-data block anomaly detection
method based on spectral clustering algorithm. In the method, the
corresponding feature spaces of different data source are fused into
an overall feature space, and using abnormal score to achieve anom-
aly judgement; in the data set, the abnormal score of the sample is
defined by the each sample in different data source for the difference
between the membership degree of each cluster structure[27].

𝑡

In this paper, some important concepts are defined: the feature
space of the different data source is called single feature space, the
expression is 𝑆𝐹𝑚×𝑑𝑘
= [𝐴𝑡 ∈ 𝑃𝑚×𝑑𝑘 ], where 𝐴𝑡 represents the
data of 𝑡 th data source, 𝑑𝑘 represents dimension; the feature space
of each data source constitutes a full feature space, and the ex-
pression is 𝐶𝑆𝐹𝑚×((cid:205)𝑛
, . . . , 𝐶𝑆𝐹𝑚×𝑑𝑘
].
The difference between membership degree of anomaly data in full
feature space is bigger than it in single feature space[29].

3.2 Social Anomaly Detection based on GNN
By spectral clustering, a full feature space of anomaly event based
on multi data source and the characterization coefficient matrix is
defined. First the model uses GNN to extracts the network element
information (node, edge) of the full feature space at 𝑡, to form
characterization of the feature, and then using the unsupervised
representation learning algorithm DGI of the graph take the entire
network at current moment to represent as a one-dimensional
vector; Using RRCF algorithms to obtain the abnormal score of
every moment[1]. In order to effectively use the graph information
at every moment, we use long short term memory network (LSTMs)
to obtain and process the change information of the global network
representation at every moment. The framework of GNN algorithm
is show in Fig. 4:

Figure 4: Framework of GNN algorithm.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, social network structure data and social text data
collected online will be respectively used to evaluate the proposed
method of this paper.

4.1 Experimental Data
In the paper, we use real multi-sources data set for experiment, and
the data set is main from the micro-blog data set and sina social
platform data set. Twenty thousand social message records are
randomly sampled from the collected social micro-blog data set and
sina social platform; the data set includes text data, picture data,
and video data; In the datasets the 60% as a training sample, 20%
as verification sample, and 20% as test sample; the 10,000 social
micro-blog messages contain 7,880 manually marked messages of
social events.

In order to eliminate the inaccurate data in the data set, and
some irrelevant data are made by the network node exception, and
some data collected repeatedly, and some data with wrong format
or null value; these data need to be pre-processed to find out the
data set; the data pre-processed is key step for mode, and feature
representation provides reliable data guarantee for the algorithm[7].
In the paper, we use principal component analysis(PCA) as he

PCA is a multivariate statistical
analysis method in which several variables are linearly transformed
to select a small number of important variables. Also it is known
as principal component analysis. The idea of PCA is to delete the
redundant variables (closely related variables) for all the variables
originally proposed, and establish as few new variables as possible,
so that these new variables are paredly unrelated, and these new
variables keep the original information as much as possible in
reflecting the information of the subject. The main steps of principal
component analysis are as follows:

• Standardization of index data;
• The correlation between the indicators;
• Determine the number of principal components 𝑚;
• Principal component expression;
• Principal component naming.

4.2 Experimental Result
To better verify the SP-GNN method we mentioned in this paper, the
other methods Support Vector Machine(SVM) and convolutional
neural network (CNN) are employed as a contrast. Accuracy and
Macro − 𝐹1 scores are selected as evaluation index of the model.
In order to ensure the accuracy of the results, we repeated the
experiment for three times and took the average value as the final
result. The experimental results are shown in the Fig. 5.

Figure 5: Comparison of experimental results.

Accuracy and Macro−𝐹1 of the SP-GNN model in social anomaly
events is respectively better than the other method. The experi-
mental results fully illustrate the proposed method is an effective
means in in social anomaly events detection based on multi-data
source. By drawing Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve
to analyse the performance of the proposed method and baseline
methds. The ROC curve is the corresponding values for each result
of model anomaly. The results are demonstrated in the Fig. 6.

From the result, we can see that the area under the ROC curve is
more bigger, and the performance of the model is better. The area
under SP-GNN curve is the most biggest, and the performance of the
SP-GNN method is superior to the baseline methods in exception
object detection based on multi-data source. As can be seen from
Fig. 7, SP-GNN generally gives a high score to the anomaly graphs
in the 800 to 1400 plots where the anomaly is most concentrated.

Figure 6: The ROC curve for results of anomaly detection.

Figure 7: Anomaly score obtained by SP-GNN.

The clustering results of the proposed method are shown in Fig.
8, and the clustering results of CNN and LSTM are showed in Fig.
9, in Fig. 10 respectively. From the three figure, we can seen our
method is superior to the other methods.

5 CONCLUSION
We address the problem of anomaly event detection in secure criti-
cal infrastructure domain. In the paper, we design a novel anom-
aly detection method based on multi-source data. We first lever-
age spectral clustering algorithm for feature extraction and fu-
sion of multiple data sources. Second, we adopt deep graph neural
network(Deep-GNN) to perform a fine-gained anomaly social event
detection, which reveals the threatening events and guarantee the
critical infrastructure security. Experimental results show that our
method has good robustness and adaption. Compared with the other
anomaly detection algorithms, our method has a good performance
index.
