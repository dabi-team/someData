Abstract—Power systems are susceptible to natural threats
including hurricanes and ﬂoods. Modern power grids are also in-
creasingly threatened by cyber attacks. Existing approaches that
help improve power system security and resilience may not be
sufﬁcient; this is evidenced by the continued challenge to supply
energy to all customers during severe events. This paper presents
an approach to address this challenge through bio-inspired
power system network design to improve system reliability and
resilience against disturbances. Inspired by naturally robust
ecosystems, this paper considers the optimal ecological robustness
that recognizes a unique balance between pathway efﬁciency
and redundancy to ensure the survivability against disruptive
events for given networks. This paper presents an approach
that maximizes ecological robustness in transmission network
design by formulating a mixed-integer nonlinear programming
optimization problem with power system constraints. The results
show the increase of the optimized power system’s robustness
and the improved reliability with less violations under N − x
contingencies.

I. INTRODUCTION

Power systems are large-scale geographically distributed
critical infrastructures that support other critical infrastruc-
tures and the functions of modern society, so resilience of
these systems is a critical need. Their widespread presence
inevitably exposes them to natural disasters such as hurricanes,
earthquakes, ﬂoods, etc. [1] which can result in blackouts
of different scales. The grid resilience report by the US
National Academies calls for enhanced power system abilities
to prepare for, endure, and recover from severe hazards [2].
The 2019 New York City Blackout, reportedly due to the
malfunction of an aging transformer [3], motivates grid up-
grades and construction. Modern power grids require not only
advanced technology, but also reliable construction, to secure
grid function and improve resilience. Power grid infrastructure
in developed countries have served the load for over a century.
The challenge going forward is thus how to invest, strengthen,
and redesign power grid networks to improve resilience for
increasing demand and dependence on electric energy.

Power system resilience has been deﬁned with time-
dependent metrics capturing critical system degradation and
recovery characteristics [4]. To enhance resilience, methods
have been proposed for different event stages. For example,

Panteli et al list several aspects of boosting power system
resilience, such as enhanced situational awareness, deployment
of renewables, network reconﬁguration, and strengthening
construction [5]. Risk to power system assets based on steady-
state and transient analysis respectively along with cyber
threats is prioritized in [6], [7] for improved cyber-physical
situational awareness. In [8], Khoshjahan et al. formulate
an optimization framework to enhance power grid ﬂexibility
with renewable energy. An algorithm for early detection and
correction of power system insecurity at minimum cost has
been proposed in [9]. In any stage, a strategic network design
lays the foundation for ﬂexible operations and can itself
mitigate some disturbances; we deﬁne this as robust network
design, and it is the focus of this paper.

Power network design necessitates considering realistic
power system constraints [10] and reliability guidelines, i.e.,
from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation
(NERC). To deal with these considerations all together, dif-
ferent network expansion frameworks have been proposed.
In [11], Kazerooni et al formulate the transmission network
planning problem to minimize the sum of annual genera-
tor operating costs and annuitized transmission investment
cost. To deal with the uncertainty of renewable generation
and load, Jabr proposes a robust optimization approach for
transmission network expansion planning [12]. Moreover, the
network structure of power grids draws signiﬁcant attention
from network and topological perspectives, which aim to
analyze the robustness of power systems with complex net-
work concepts and provide insights for robust power network
design [13], [14]. To provide a systematic resilient network
design, it is important to have a valid benchmark for the
problem formulation and analyses. Thus, in this paper, we refer
to ecosystems, whose network structures have been shown
to be sustainable over time while effectively withstanding
disturbances, as our guideline for resilient network design, as
described below.

As shown in Fig. 1, the structure of food webs and power
systems are similar. The actors and material exchange in food
webs correspond to power system components and power
transfer respectively. Biological ecosystems have developed
over millions of years to survive disturbances, and they provide
a benchmark for robust, sustainable, and efﬁcient networks
design. Ulanowicz et al introduce ecological robustness to

topologies of a power grid (left) and a food web (right) [15].

measure the potential of food webs to sustain over time [16].
In [15], [17], Panyam et al. introduce the bio-inspired robust
power network design that applies ecological robustness to
transmission network analyses and design based on network
structure and real power ﬂows. After applying ecological
robustness as the objective to optimize the network structure,
robustness is improved. Compared with original networks,
the bio-inspired power networks can withstand more high-
impact events using an ?N − x? reliability evaluation criteria
[18]. However, this preliminary approach only focused on
the topological structure; it did not consider power system
constraints, which is a necessity for power network expansion.
In this paper, we build the bio-inspired robust power
network design problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear pro-
gramming optimization problem in PowerModels.jl [19]
with DC and AC power ﬂow models respectively. Then, we
compare the results to see how power ﬂow models affect
the power networks that are designed. In this paper, we
focus on the design of transmission network structure and
keep the generator location and load ﬁxed. However, it is
worth mentioning that generator placement, generation output,
and load variation can also potentially affect the ecological
robustness and can be considered in a similar way. A further
analysis and the development of bio-inspired power networks
with all these factors is our future work.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

• We formulate the bio-inpsired power networks design
problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization prob-
lem to directly optimize the physical network structure
while satisfying power system operational constraints.
• With PowerModels.jl [19], we solve the bio-inspired
power network design problem with DC and AC power
ﬂow models respectively and analyze the inﬂuence of
different power ﬂow models for the network design.
• We also compare and analyze the similarities and differ-
ences of the optimal network design in [15], [17] and in
this paper with N − x contingency analysis.

Section II reviews the related work of applying ecological
robustness into power network design. Section III introduces
the proposed mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem.
Case studies and discussion of the bio-inspired power network
design are in Section IV. The conclusion and future work are

II. RELATED WORK

Our previous work has applied ecological robustness into
power networks design and analysis in [15], [17], where
we model power systems as prey-predator interactions in a
food web and construct an Ecological Flow Matrix [T] with
real power ﬂow for ecological robustness optimization and
analysis. The ability of bio-inspired design to improve the
ecological robustness and reliability of a network is shown
in [15], [17]. Fig. 2 shows the ecological robustness curve
for the ﬁve grids and their bio-inspired versions and a set
of 38 food webs as comparison. The robustness of original
power networks are much lower than the naturally robust
food webs, which indicates their network structure is more
efﬁcient but less redundant. Analysis in [17] is performed on
5-bus, 6-bus, 7-bus, 9-bus, and 14-bus systems from [20] and
the results show that the bio-optimized power networks have
higher robustness with added redundancy and they are more
reliable under N − 1, N − 2 and N − 3 contingencies.

Ecological robustness, R,

is based on the concept of
surprisal, which is a dimensionless metric. It is formulated
as a function of two opposing but complementary attributes:
unutilized reserve capacity and effective performance. The
optimal ecological robustness represents a unique balance be-
tween pathway efﬁciency and redundancy for a given network
that can survive from more disturbances. The formulation of R
is shown in Eq. (1) with total system throughput (TSTp) [21],
development capacity (DC) [22], and ascendency (ASC)
[23], [24].

TSTp is the system size, measured by total units of energy

certainty that a network can have. ASC reﬂects the order or

Objective:

The bio-inspired robust power network design optimization

with power system constraints is shown as follows:

Variables:

V i
Q ij

(∀ i ∈ N), P gen i (∀ i ∈ G), P ij
(∀ (i,j) ∈ B ∪ NB) ,α ij ∈ {0,1} (∀ (i,j) ∈ NB)

(∀ (i,j) ∈ B ∪ NB)

where Ti and Tj are the sum of all ﬂows out of i and into
j respectively. The Ecological Flow Matrix [T] is a square
(N +3) x (N +3) matrix, where N is the number of actors, and
the extra entries represent the system inputs, useful exports,
and dissipation [25].

The above formulation of R allows the quantiﬁcation of
robustness as a function of pathway redundancy and efﬁciency,
which has been shown in ecosystems to be directly related to
the long-term survival of a network [26]. In ecosystems, the
maximum R is achieved with a unique ratio of ASC/DC, whose
value is 0.367 or 1/e.

III. MIXED-INTEGER NONLINEAR OPTIMIZATION
PROBLEM FORMULATION
The goal for bio-inspired power network design is to create
a network that is maximally robust (based on the ecological
deﬁnition) against large-scale hazards, while respecting real-
world power system constraints. To compute and optimize the
ecological robustness for power systems, we focus on the real
power ﬂows and formulate the Ecological Flow Matrix as
in [17]. However, unlike [15], [17], this paper presents an
optimization problem that directly optimizes the power grid
physical structure instead of the Ecological Flow Matrix. In
this way, power system operational constraints, such as thermal
limits, voltage magnitude limits, etc., are included.

For power grids, actors correspond to generators and buses,
system inputs correspond to energy from generators, useful
exports are the load (consumption), and dissipation is the
losses in the system. The entries in [T] are notated as Tij
and represent the directed ﬂow from node i to node j, corre-
sponding to real power ﬂows [17]. An illustrative Ecological
Flow Matrix using a 5-bus case from PowerModels.jl [27]
transmission network expansion problem is shown in Fig. 3.
This case has 5 buses, 5 generators, and 3 loads. The loads
are located at Bus 2, Bus 3, and Bus 4 respectively. There
are 4 branches in the system, and 3 candidates of branches
to be built. Using the Ecological Flow Matrix, the optimal
ecological robustness can guide the design of a secure and
resilient network.

To include power system operational constraints, we intro-
duce a binary decision variable α for branches, whose value
is either one or zero. For example, αij is the binary decision
variable for branch from bus i to bus j. With the proposed
optimization, if the resulting αij equals one, it suggests to
build this branch to achieve optimal ecological robustness.
it suggests not. With the integration of power

ﬂow equations, the outputs of the generators are also decision
variables. In this way, we can also optimize the operating point
for the system based on ecological robustness.

where EFM is Ecological Flow Matrix, B is the set of existing
branches, N B is the set of candidates of new branches, N is
the set of buses, and G is the set of generators.

The objective function (5a) is formulated through Equation
(1)-(4). The input of the objective function is a function of
EFM, which is consisted of power ﬂows, generation output,
power loss and load of the interested power grid network as
shown in Fig.3.

With the binary decision variable α and the formulation of
ecological robustness R, this optimization problem becomes

mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP),
which is a typical class of NP-hard problem [28]. To solve
this problem, we build our model with PowerModels.jl
[19], [27], which provides various libraries for power system
optimization problems.

IV. CASE STUDIES

PowerModels.jl is a Julia-based [29] open-source plat-
form for comparing and evaluating different power ﬂow
formulations on actively researched optimization problems,
including Optimal Power Flow (OPF), Transmission Network
Expansion Planning (TNEP), Optimal Transmission Switching
(OTS), etc [27]. In this paper, we combine the TNEP in
PowerModels.jl with our bio-inspired power network de-
sign problem to fully utilize its existing modeling components
and formulate our own objective with ecological robustness.
Based on the proposed mixed-integer nonlinear optimization
model, we build the bio-inspired robust power network design
problem in PowerModels.jl and evaluate it for the 5-
bus network expansion case from PowerModels.jl and a
PowerWorld Simulator 6-bus case [20] using both DC and
AC models. To solve the MINLP, we use the Ipopt [30],
the nonlinear optimization solver, Juniper [31], the nonlinear
integer program solver, and Cbc [32],
the mixed integer
program solver. The solvers are conﬁgured to stop when the
desired convergence tolerance is less than 10−4 or the solver
has run over 1500 seconds.

In this paper, we formulate the bio-inspired power network
design optimization problem with DC and AC power models
respectively and apply the formulation to the 5-bus network
expansion case from PowerModels.jl, which is under
contingency with one overloaded branch and two over capacity
generators due to the removal of whose Branch 1-2 and
Branch 1-4 (f rom bus − to bus), and the 6-bus case
from PowerWorld Simulator [20], which is under normal
operation. We add network expansion candidate branches
to the original network to ﬁt the cases into the proposed
model. In our case, the branch candidates are chosen to be

Branch 1-2, Branch 1-4 and Branch 2-4 in the 5-
bus network expansion case as shown in Fig. 4. Branch 1-2
and Branch 1-4 are removed from the original network.
Branch 2-4 is a new branch and its parameters, such as
resistance, reactance, susceptance and limit, are the same as
Branch 1-4. The original 6-bus case is a normal power grid
case with no contingency. To ﬁt the proposed power network
optimization, we select three candidates from the results of
[17] in branch.ne with Branch 1-4, Branch 2-4 and
Branch 4-3 as shown in Fig. 5. The electrical parameters
for the new branches are the same as the existing branches.

cases are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 respectively. It can be
clearly seen that the optimal network design only chooses two
more branches for both cases, and their optimal ecological
robustness is much higher than the ones obtained in [17].
In [15], [17], the optimization model searches all possible
connections for a given network; however, the proposed op-
timization model pre-deﬁnes the searching space of 3 candi-
dates, which can reduce the number of constructed branches.
Besides, with the integration of power ﬂow equations, the
proposed optimization model not only guides the network
design, but also adjusts the power ﬂow dispatch to achieve
the maximum robustness. Moreover, with the optimization in
[17], it takes 130 seconds to solve the optimal network design
for the 6-bus case in MATLAB using f mincon function with
a full search. With the mixed-integer optimization in Julia, it
only takes 0.716 seconds with the DC power ﬂow model and
1.789 seconds with the AC power ﬂow model with predeﬁned
searching space. While the two optimization problems are
solved in different platforms with different solvers, constraints,
and search space, making it
is hard to directly compare
the efﬁciency for them, PowerModels.jl demonstrates its
efﬁciency and capability for solving emerging power system
optimization problems. Moreover,
the MINLP formulation
provides more ﬂexibility to choose candidates, since users
can determine the candidates in advance. With geographic and
economic studies, users can provide feasible and economical
candidates for the model.

The optimization is locally solved with feasible solutions
they are
for both cases with DC power ﬂow model, but
locally infeasible with AC power ﬂow model. The proposed
mixed-integer nonlinear optimization for bio-inspired network
design is particularly complicated because the mixed-integer
optimization is a NP hard problem and its objective function
includes the natural logarithm, which requires the domain to
be positive. With the integration of power system constraints,
the feasible space for such problem is further reduced. For
the 6-bus case, if we increase the number of candidates for
branch.ne, the problem will not be solved. Thus, for different
cases and power ﬂow models, it needs further relaxation to
obtain an optimal and feasible solution.

For the 6-bus case, we perform the N − x contingency
analysis to compare the reliability of different network de-
signs and the results are in Table II. We compare the case
with the original network structure, the PowerModel.jl
TNEP optimization structure, the bio-inspired network design
from [17] and the proposed MINLP bio-inspired network
design. The PowerModel.jl TNEP optimization problem
constructs extra branches to ensure the system can function

securely with minimum construction cost. Since the 6-bus
case can function safely, the output of the 6-bus case through
PowerModel.jl TNEP model is the same as the original
one. It satisﬁes the TNEP model that ensures the system can
function without violating any power system constraints with
zero construction cost. The considered violation in this paper
is the branch overﬂow in the system under N −x contingency,
which is the same as in [17]. From the result, it can be seen that
the bio-inspired networks are more reliable than the original
network and PowerModel.jl TNEP by encountering less
number of violations under contingencies. However, compared
with the bio-inspired network in [17], the MINLP bio-inspired
network is less reliable with a slightly higher number of
violations in N − 2 and N − 3 contingency analysis, but the
violations are still much less than the original network. From
economic perspective, the MINLP bio-inspired network builds
less transmission lines than the network in [17], which reduces
the construction cost.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we present a resilience-focused power grid
network design optimization with realistic power system con-
straints inspired by ecological networks. To integrate power
system constraints, the optimization is formulated as a MINLP
problem and solved in PowerModels.jl with both DC and
AC power ﬂow models. The DC power ﬂow models can be
solved with optimal solution, but the AC power ﬂow models
cannot ﬁnd the feasible solution. A particular challenge of
solving the proposed MINLP problem is how to ensure the
problem can ﬁnd a feasible solution under the power system
constraints and natural logarithm’s domain requirement. With
the integration of power ﬂow equations, the MINLP opti-
mization not only strategically chooses the branches, but also
adjusts the generator output to achieve the optimal ecological
robustness. From the contingency analysis for the 6-bus case
with different network structures, we observe the improvement
of power system reliability through the mixed-integer bio-
inspired network design. Even though the improvement is
not as much as our previous bio-inspired network design,
the branches to be built are reduced, which reduces the
construction cost. Moreover, there are only three candidates to
search within the proposed method, unlike the global search
in our previous work, which may miss other optimal points
with different candidates.

economic analysis of the networks being optimized to consider
construction costs as well as economic lost under contingen-
cies. The plan then is to incorporate economic parameters into
the optimization formulation to result in a cost-effective robust
power network design. Additionally, while generator outputs
are already included decision variables, future work will also
investigate the placement of generators and renewable energies
for a resilient power network design.
