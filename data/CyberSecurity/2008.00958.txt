Abstract.  Critical  infrastructure  systems  like  power  grid  require  an  improved 
critical information infrastructure (CII) that can not only help in monitoring of 
the  critical  entities but  also  take part  in  failure  analysis  and  self-healing.  Effi-
cient designing of a CII is challenging as each kind of communication technol-
ogy has its own advantages and disadvantages. Wired networks are highly scal-
able and secure, but they are neither cost effective nor dynamic in nature. Wire-
less communication technologies on the other hand are easy to deploy, low cost 
etc.  but  they  are  vulnerable  to  cyber-attacks.  In order  to optimize  cost,  power 
consumption, dynamic nature, accuracy and scalability a hybrid communication 
network  is  designed  in  this  paper  where  a  portion  of  the  communication  net-
work is built using wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the rest is a wired net-
work of fiber optic channels. To offer seamless operation of the hybrid commu-
nication  network  and  provide  security  a  Secure  Smart  Grid  Monitoring  Tech-
nique (SSGMT) is also proposed. The performance of the proposed hybrid CII 
for  the  generation  and  transmission  system  of  power  grid  coupled  with  the 
SSGMT during different cyber-attacks is tested using NS2 simulator. The simu-
lation results show that the SSGMT for a joint power communication network 
of IEEE 118-Bus system performs better than the prevailing wireless  CIIs like 
Lo-ADI and Modified AODV.

Introduction 

An improved and efficient Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) for a  Critical In-
frastructure System (CIS) gives birth to a smart CIS. It is the incorporation of features 
like full-duplex communication between the CII entities by the addition of embedded 
systems, automated metering in the smart homes, power distribution automation, per-
vasive monitoring etc., that converts a traditional power grid to a smart grid system. It 
is  beyond  any  question  that  the  CII  of  a  smart  grid  must  be  accurate,  scalable,  and 
secure  enough  to  instantly  identify  any  kind  of  abnormal behavior  in  the  entities  of 
the power network, securely communicate that information to the control center and 
thereby  help  in  taking  necessary  and  timely  action  to  ensure  uninterrupted  power 
supply. 

As a result, finding the best suited design of a robust CII for smart grid has become 
a  boiling  topic  of  research.  In  [1]  a  crude  idea  of  the  design  of  a  joint  power-

2 

communication network is given using a test system  consisting of 14 buses. Yet, the 
ground level details of the CII system are missing. The authors of [2], have come up 
with a realistic design of the CII of a smart grid by taking help from a power utility in 
the U.S. Southwest; their CII system relies completely on wired channels that either 
use  SONET-over-Ethernet  or  Ethernet-over-Dense  Wavelength  Division  Multiplex-
ing.  However,  a  completely  wired  CII  is  neither  cost  effective  nor  energy  saving. 
Every CII entity in [2] draws power and thus a huge amount of power is devoted for 
monitoring the power network itself. Moreover, isolation of CII entities during a fail-
ure or a security threat and addition of a new entity in the network for hardening pur-
pose or fault tolerance is extremely difficult and costly in a wired system.  

Smart sensors like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are already gaining popular-
ity in smart grid system for measuring electrical waves. Power generation and trans-
mission, power quality, equipment fitness, load capacity of equipment and load bal-
ancing in the grid can also be monitored by data sensing techniques. WSNs are com-
prised of low powered sensor nodes with easy installation process, lesser maintenance 
requirement,  low  installation  cost,  low  power  profile,  high  accuracy  and  scalability. 
All  these  have  convinced  the  researchers  that  WSNs  are  a  very good  choice  for  the 
designing of the CII of a smart grid. However, the most common drawback of a sen-
sor node is that it is battery powered and it is not easy to replace its dead battery. As a 
result,  energy  conservation  becomes  important.  In  the  proposed  work,  energy  effi-
ciency  is  obtained  by  both  energy  aware  routing  technique  for  Supervisory  Control 
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data transmission and by the use of more expensive 
rechargeable Energy Harvesting Relay Nodes (EHRNs) for PMU data transmission to 
the  Control  Centers  (CC).  Also,  the  nodes  and  wireless  channels  are  vulnerable  to 
cyber-attacks. Some of the common cyber-attacks in WSNs are discussed in [3]. 

 In this paper, a hybrid CII is designed in which a WSN based communication net-
work  is  used  between  a  sensing  unit  placed  at  a  substation  like  a  Remote  Terminal 
Unit  (RTU)  or  a  PMU  and  a  regional  aggregation  point  like  a  Regional  Sink  node 
(RS)  or  Phasor  Data  Concentrator;  and  optical  fiber  based  communication  is  used 
between  the  regional  aggregation  point  and  the  CCs.  SSGMT  aims  at  securing  the 
sensed  data  by  means  of  light  weight  security  protocols  used  in  [4]  like  Elliptic-
Curve-Public-Key Cryptography (ECC), Elliptic-Curve-Diffie-Helman Key exchange 
scheme  (ECDH),  Nested  Hash  Message  Authentication  Codes  (NHMAC)  and  RC5 
symmetric cypher. 

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview  of the 
CII  system  setup  phase  for  SSGMT.  Mitigation  of  different  threats  to  the  proposed 
network design is discussed in section 3 by adopting a secure routing technique. Sec-
tion 4 does performance analysis of the proposed scheme SSGMT by means of com-
paring the simulation results with  other existing secure remote monitoring technique 
for  power  grid  like  Lo-ADI  [5]  and  Modified  AODV  [6].  Sections  5  concludes  the 
paper and discusses the scope for future works.

Overview of the CII system setup phase for SSGMT 

In order to provide a reliable remote monitoring technique for the smart grid, a gener-
ic  hybrid  CII  system  design  is  proposed  in  this  section  that  can  be  applied  on  any 
given power network.  In order to illustrate the steps of CII design, the generation and 
transmission part of a power grid formed by the IEEE 14-Bus system is considered. 

Fig. 1. Critical Information Infrastructure Design for a Smart Grid of IEEE 14-Bus 

Initially,  a  given  power  grid  is  divided  into  several  substations  based  on  [7].  In 
Fig.1,  the  IEEE  14-Bus  system  is  divided  into  11  substations.  After  the  substation 
division,  two  substations  having  the  highest  and  second  highest  connectivity  with 
other substations are selected as Main and  backup CCs respectively. As the CCs are 
selected, all substations are equipped with a router acting as a gateway (𝐺𝑊𝑖) and a 
substation server is placed in each CC acting as the access point for the operator. The 
CC- gateways can receive optical signals from the optical channels and convert them 
to electrical signals using a photodiode and send those data to server via a wired LAN 
connection.  Other  𝐺𝑊𝑖𝑠  can  receive  data  from  the  sensors  in  that  substation  via 
Zigbee and forward that to either the non-rechargeable relay nodes or the EHRNs. 

The distance between all pairs of substations (𝑆𝑖& 𝑆𝑗) is calculated as in [2]. Now, 
starting  from  a  substation 𝑆𝑖 with  the  maximum  connectivity  among  the  border  sub-
stations, all other substations which are within a given distance D of 𝑆𝑖, are marked as 
substations of a common monitoring region 𝑅𝑥. D is determined on the basis of net-
work size and average distance between substations.  Then the next substation which 

 
4 

is  the  closest  to 𝑆𝑖 but  beyond  the  given  distance  and  which  is  not  yet  placed  in  a 
monitoring region, is selected and the same process is repeated. This process is con-
tinued till every substation is placed within a particular 𝑅𝑥. In Fig.1, 𝑆1 is selected as 
the main CC and 𝑆2 is selected as the backup CC. Substations 𝑆3, 𝑆4, 𝑆5 and 𝑆10 are at 
the  borders  of  the  smart  grid  area.  Among  them, 𝑆4 has  the  maximum  connectivity, 
therefore  the  region  division  starts  from  it  and  finally,  the  smart  grid  network  for 
IEEE 14-Bus system is divided into 3 monitoring regions. 

In SSGMT, two different types of Zigbee enabled smart sensors are considered for 
monitoring  the  power  network  entities.  The  first  type  is  the  Measuring  Unit  (MU) 
based smart sensors [8] connected to an RTU for measuring SCADA input data and 
the second type is the Zigbee enabled PMU-based smart sensors or ZPMU [9].  

In this step, MU-based sensors (𝑀𝑖) are placed at every bus but PMU-based sen-
sors (𝑃𝑖) are placed at some of the buses using an optimal PMU placement algorithm 
[7]. If there are multiple 𝑀𝑖s in a substation then RTU receives the data from all such 
𝑀𝑖 s  before  forwarding  them  to  the  substation  gateway  ( 𝐺𝑊𝑖 ).  Low-cost,  non-
rechargeable battery enabled  relay nodes are randomly dispersed across the network 
area. These relay nodes can carry the SCADA data to a RS placed at every monitoring 
region. Each RSs is either connected to a neighboring RS or a CC-gateway via optical 
fiber channels to form a ring structure in order to provide fault tolerance.  These RSs 
now  convert  the  electrical  signals  obtained  from  the  relay  nodes  to  optical  signals 
using a light emitting diode, associated with each RS.  These optical signals are then 
carried to the CC-gateways via optical fiber channels and other RSs in the ring. TCP 
based communication is used between the RSs and the CC-gateway.  

A  phasor  data  concentrator  (PDC),  responsible  for  receiving  and  accumulating 
PMU  data  from multiple  PMUs,  is  also  placed  at  each  region  of  the  smart grid  and 
few EHRNs are randomly deployed across the smart grid region. The idea behind the 
deployment  of  the  two  kinds  of  sensor  nodes  is  that,  the  cheaper  non-rechargeable 
relay  nodes  will  follow  an  event-driven  hierarchical  routing  approach  to  send  the 
SCADA data and the EHRNs will always be active to accumulate synchrophasor data 
from the substations of each region and send the data to the local PDCs and finally to 
the CC-gateways. Due to the high volume of PMU data transfer from each substation 
having  a  PMU,  the  sensor  nodes  carrying  them  should  always  be  active.  IEEE 
C37.118 standard is maintained for communication of PMU data to the PDCs. PDCs 
can convert the data to optical signals in the similar way as RSs and send that to the 
CC-gateways either directly or via other PDCs in neighboring regions. PDCs also use 
TCP based communication to send the optical data to CCs.

Secure Smart Grid Monitoring Technique (SSGMT)  

The goal of the  CII for a smart grid is to securely transmit the sensed data from the 
sensors  to  the  CCs  and  help  in  remote  monitoring  of  the  power  grid.  In  order  to 
achieve this with the help of a hybrid CII, the SSGMT is divided into 3 modules and 
described in this section. 

5 

3.1  Module 1: Data sensing by substation sensors and forwarding to 

substation gateways 

In the first module of SSGMT,  the 𝑀𝑖 and 𝑃𝑖 sensors placed in the substations sense 
electrical waves from the buses they are placed on and use Zigbee to send the data to 
the  substation  gateway 𝐺𝑊𝑖.  No  security  measure  is  adopted  in  this  step  as  it  is  as-
sumed that no cyber attack can harm the communication within a substation.  

3.2  Module 2: Data forwarding by substation gateways to RSs and PDCs 

The next phase of the hybrid CII system of SSGMT is data forwarding by 𝐺𝑊𝑖𝑠. 𝐺𝑊𝑖 
Use two separate methods for forwarding 𝑀𝑖 and 𝑃𝑖 data. First, the trust values (𝑇𝑉𝑖) 
of  the  non-rechargeable  nodes  (𝑁𝑖) and  EHRNs  are  determined  by  the 𝐺𝑊𝑖𝑠 of  that 
region by means  of  forwarding  a number  of  test  messages  through  them  to  the  RSs 
and PDCs of that region respectively. The 𝑇𝑉𝑖 of each node is calculated using eq.1. 

                                               𝑇𝑉𝑖 =

𝑀𝑆𝐺𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑
𝑀𝑆𝐺𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡

∗ 100                                           (1) 

It is assumed that all the CII entities are provided with a global key 𝐺𝐵𝐾 which an 
attacker  cannot  get  hold  of  even  if  the  entity  is  compromised.  Also,  a  unique  set  of 
elliptic curves is stored in the memory of each CII entity for the purpose of ECC and 
ECDH protocols [4]. Also, in order to achieve those mechanisms, it is assumed that 
any pair of entities in the network agrees upon all the domain parameters of the ellip-
tic curves stored in them. Now, rest of module 2 is described using the flowchart be-
low. 

RC5 symmetric cipher [4] is  used for the encryption of data using the shared se-
cret.  The  GBK  is  used  by 𝐺𝑊𝑖 to  generate  a  Hashed  Message  Authentication  Code 

 
 
6 

(HMAC)  [4] over  both  the  encrypted  SCADA  and  PMU  data  and  attached  with  the 
encrypted  data  for  the  purpose  of  authentication  of  data.  Eq  2.  is  used  to  select  the 
cluster  head. 𝑁𝑖  nodes  receiving  data  from 𝐺𝑊𝑖  and  with  highest  Candidate  Value 
(𝐶𝑉𝑖) is selected as the cluster head.  
                                                 𝐶𝑉𝑖 = 𝐵𝑃𝑖 ∗ 𝑇𝑉𝑖 ∗ 𝐶𝑛𝑖                                                            (2) 
In eq.2,  𝐵𝑃𝑖 represents remaining battery power of 𝑁𝑖, 𝑇𝑉𝑖 is the current trust val-
ue  of 𝑁𝑖 and 𝐶𝑛𝑖  is  the  connectivity  of 𝑁𝑖 with  other  nodes  in  the  region.  The  same 
path to send data  to RSs and PDCs is followed by each 𝐺𝑊𝑖 until the  RSs or PDCs 
send a rerouting request to the corresponding 𝐺𝑊𝑖. 

3.3  Module 3: Data forwarding by RSs and PDCs to CC-gateways 

In this module, the RSs and PDCs after obtaining the encrypted and HMAC-ed data 
from the 𝑁𝑠 and EHRNs use the shared secret obtained for that sender 𝐺𝑊𝑖 to decrypt 
the  data  packets.  They  also  match  the  HMAC  attached  with  the  encrypted  data  to 
check if any false data injection took place. In case, the HMAC does not match, the 
data packet is dropped, and rerouting request is sent back to the sender. The main CC-
server use ECC based public key cryptography [4] and generate a public key for en-
cryption and a private key for decryption of data. The  ECC based public key of the 
main CC-server is sent to each of the RSs through the RS-ring and also to the PDCs 
via other PDCs and the optical channels. The main CC-gateway use a dedicated and 
secure optical channel to communicate with the backup CC-gateway. This channel is 
used to share the private key with the backup CC-server. RSs are responsible for data 
aggregation.  Aggregated  SCADA  data  from  the 𝑁𝑠 are  encrypted  by  the  RSs  using 
the  public  key  of  the  main  CC-server.  This  encrypted  data  is  sent  to  both  the  CC-
gateways via the RS-ring. In the similar way PDCs send the aggregated and encrypted 
synchrophasor  data  via  other  PDCs  to  the  CC-gateways  wherefrom  they  reach  the 
CC-servers.

In this section, the CII for a smart grid network of IEEE 118-Bus system is consid-
ered. The total network region is divided into 8 regions and the power grid is divided 
into  107  substations.  Substation  61  is  selected  as  the  main  CC  and  it  consists  of  3 
buses─68,69 and 116. Substation 16, consisting of buses─17 and 30, is selected as the 
backup CC. In order to analyze the performance of SSGMT in this network setup, a 
total of 1500 non-rechargeable relay nodes, 500 EHRNs and 8 PDCs are deployed in 
the network area and NS2.29 is used for simulation. The simulation results are com-
pared  with  existing  WSN  based  CII  systems  like  Lo-ADI  [5]  and  modified  AODV 
[6].

Conclusion and Future Works 

The region based remote monitoring adopted by  SSGMT helps in easy identification 
of a failure in the power grid or an attack in the communication network of the smart 
grid.  SSGMT  obtains  data  privacy  by  the  encryption/decryption  mechanisms,  data 
integrity and authenticity by the HMACs. Delay, security, power consumption, scala-
bility etc. are optimized by this hybrid network design of SSGMT. Designing a threat 
model with attacks on smart sensors, gateways or servers and analyzing the effect of 
cyber-attacks on power grid can be another direction of future work.
