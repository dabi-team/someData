Abstract—As internet related challenges increase such as
cyber-attacks, the need for safe practises among users to maintain
computer system’s health and online security have become
imperative, and this is known as cyber-hygiene. Poor cyber-
hygiene among internet users is a very critical issue undermining
the general acceptance and adoption of internet technology. It
has become a global issue and concern in this digital era when
virtually all business transactions, learning, communication and
many other activities are performed online. Virus attack, poor
authentication technique, improper ﬁle backups and the use of
different social engineering approaches by cyber-attackers to
deceive internet users into divulging their conﬁdential informa-
tion with the intention to attack them have serious negative
implications on the industries and organisations, including ed-
ucational institutions. Moreover, risks associated with these ugly
phenomena are likely to be more in developing countries such as
Nigeria. Thus, authors of this paper undertook an online pilot
study among students and employees of University of Nigeria,
Nsukka and a total of 145 responses were received and used for
the study. The survey seeks to ﬁnd out the effect of age and level
of education on the cyber hygiene knowledge and behaviour of
the respondents, and in addition, the type of devices used and
activities they engage in while on the internet. The result of
the study revealed that the independent variables, age and level
of education do not have statistical signiﬁcance on the cyber
hygiene knowledge and behaviour of the respondents. It was
equally shown from the result of the survey that mobile phone
is the most widely used device with 93.1%, followed by laptop
with 71%. The activity that these respondents perform mostly
while online is internet browsing with 94.5%, followed by online
learning with 86.9% according to our research. From our ﬁndings
also, we discovered that only 53.79% of the respondents have
good cyber hygiene knowledge, while 51.72% have good cyber
hygiene behaviour. Our ﬁndings show wide adoption of internet
in institution of higher learning, whereas, signiﬁcant number of
the internet users do not have good cyber hygiene knowledge and
behaviour. Hence, our ﬁndings can instigate an organised training
for students and employees of higher institutions in Nigeria.

positively on everyday activities in the various sectors of
human endeavours. However, this technological advancement
has equally resulted to increased cyber threats, vulnerabilities
and risks. In Nigeria, for instance,
internet has made it
possible the perpetration of different forms of cyber-crime
on daily basis ranging from fraudulent electronic mails,
pornography,
identity theft, hacking, cyber harassment,
spamming, Automated Teller Machine spooﬁng, piracy and
phishing [1].

According to [2], in the year 2016, the personal information
of millions of people were stolen through cyber-crime, which
comprises of 40 million people in United States of America
(USA), 54 million in Turkey, 20 million in Korea, 16 million
in Germany and over 20 million in China.

Moreover, these risks associated with this ugly phenomenon
are likely to be more in developing countries such as Nigeria.
In Nigeria, cyber-attacks are committed by people of different
age ranges, both old and young are involved in this act though
majority are young ones [3]. The cyber space is the main
channel through which ﬁnancial fraud is being perpetrated
in the Nigerian banking industry [4]. This therefore calls for
concerted effort to curb the menace of cyber-crime activities
on individuals, organisations and governments.

One of

the ways through which cyber-crime can be
mitigated is by improving the cyber-hygiene culture of the
internet users. Cyber-hygiene here refers to those cyber-
security attitudes and behaviours which internet users are
expected to adopt to ensure the safety and integrity of their
data and also their devices in the case of cyber-attacks by the
internet fraudsters [5].

This research through a pilot study seeks to ﬁnd out if
there is relationship between demographic factors (age and
level of education) and cyber-hygiene among students and
employees of University of Nigeria, Nsukka. An ethical
approval was obtained from the university for the purpose
of this research. This paper presents the result of the survey

education of students and staff, and cyber-hygiene. The wide
adoption of internet in tertiary institutions, coupled with quest
for migration to online learning as a result o f the outbreak
of Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) necessitated this research.

Review of Related Literature While there have been several
studies involving various users and aspects of cyber-hygiene,
there is currently is no substantial survey, which explores
cyber-hygiene by considering individual differences and the
users’ level of knowledge especially amongst students and
employees in the universities in Nigeria. The main reasons for
this research are to ﬁnd out the effect of age and educational
level on cyber-hygiene and also to ascertain the level of
cyber-hygiene knowledge and behaviour among students and
employees of University of Nigeria, Nsukka.

Previously many researchers have made ﬁndings on
cyber-hygiene cultures of internet users. Talib et al. [6]
found that 97% of users did have antivirus software at home.
Authors in [6] also reported that 72% of people who are not
trained on the topic did use ﬁrewall protection. There are
also discrepancies in the data that describes the use of Spam
protection.

The study conducted in [7] focused on understanding
the human factors and individual differences that inﬂuence
cyber-hygiene. The results demonstrated in the work indicate
that cyber-hygiene education need not
target a particular
sex or age group in terms of content or delivery method,
which contradicts previous ﬁndings from [8]. The research
carried out by authors in [8] highlighted the importance of
understanding the types of people who are more likely to
engage in the risky behavior of sharing passwords. They
found a number of variables that can be used to predict users
that engage in the risky practice of sharing passwords, which
are age, perseverance, and self-monitoring.

Research conducted in [9] seeks to examine relationships,
if any, between cyber-security awareness level and the
background of participants pursuing careers in the area of

Therefore, individuals and business organisations beneﬁt from
higher levels of security awareness, which ultimately reﬂects
higher literacy levels and learning. Lastly, business continuity
depends on how individuals respond to various situations,
exercise caution in their decisions, and ultimately, how aware
they are about current and future security risks in their doings.

A study to create awareness of

security threat and
avoidance was carried out in [10]. The study was carried
out on anti-phishing education to guard against identity theft
and related issues. It examined whether the knowledge of
cyber-hygiene concepts has effect on users’ ability to avoid
phishing attack. An online questionnaire were distributed and
collected from 161 computer users from Brunel University
and the University of Bedfordshire and their responses were
used for analysis. The ﬁnding revealed that the knowledge
of concepts enables internet users to avoid phishing attacks.
It was concluded that educating users on the knowledge of
concepts has signiﬁcant positive effects on enabling users to
avert phishing threats and attacks.

III. METHODOLOGY

A. Research Goal

The primary goal of this research is to determine the
signiﬁcance effect of certain demographic factors/variables
such as age and level of education on cyber-hygiene culture
among students and employees of University of Nigeria,
Nsukka. The reasons for choosing the university are for
convenience, cost reduction and availability of participants to
researchers. In respect to this research, an ethical approval
was sought from the university authority and it was given.
Because of prolonged Academic Staff Union of Universities in
Nigeria and lockdown necessitated by COVID-19 pandemic,
the response rate was very low. Based on this reason, the
researchers decided to take a pilot study from the received
responses to test
the
research questionnaire. An updated version of the survey will
be conducted as soon as the university reopens.

B. Instrument and Method of Data Collection

Questionnaire was the basic instrument used to gather
required data from the chosen institution. A well-structured
questionnaire was designed with Google form for the survey
and distributed via online approach using the institution’s
online mailing system and group WhatsApps to the chosen
participants. Responses from the respondents were collated
in a datasheet and were subjected for analysis.

C. Sampling Technique

Convenience sampling, a common non-probability sampling
was applied in selecting the sample used for the survey. This
sampling method is fast, cost-effective and it makes sample
easily available.

D. Sample Size

G. Research Hypotheses

3

A total of 145 responses were received and used for
this pilot study. The respondents cut across different age
ranges and educational levels to accommodate all relevant
demographics.

E. Research Model

Here in our study, the analysis of the effect of some selected
demographic factors on cyber-hygiene among students and
employees of University of Nigeria, Nsukka was carried
out. The demographic factors represent
the independent
variables, which include age and educational level whereas
cyber-hygiene represents the dependent variable in this study.
The percentage of internet usage for educational purposes
increases with the student’s age, which shows the increasing
e-learning prospect with the level of education as observed
in [11]. Some common aspects of cyber-hygiene culture
were chosen for this study namely, storage and virus attack
hygiene, social network hygiene, authentication hygiene and
social engineering hygiene. The ﬁrst three which include virus
attack hygiene, social network hygiene and authentication
hygiene were adopted from [5] with little modiﬁcation in
nomenclature. Social engineering hygiene was introduced by
the research team as users’ cyber-hygiene dimension required
to overcome the cyber-security threat considered in [12].
Questions in section B and section C of the questionnaire
were spread across these four aspects of cyber-hygiene. The
association of the independent variables and the dependent
variable is shown in Figure 1 below.

Fig. 1: Research Model

F. Research Questions

In order to ascertain if there is any signiﬁcance relationship
between demographic factors and cyber-hygiene culture, the
following research questions were raised:

1) Does age of internet users have any signiﬁcant relation-

ship with cyber-hygiene culture?

2) Does level of education of internet users have any
signiﬁcant relationship with cyber-hygiene culture?

Two null hypotheses were formulated as follows by the

researchers to answer the above research questions:

• H1: Age of internet user does not have any signiﬁcant

effect on cyber-hygiene

• H2: Level of education of internet user does not have any

signiﬁcant effect on cyber-hygiene

H. Data Analysis

Our research questionnaire in this study consist of three
sections, section A which was used to gather information
on demographic factors, type of activities they perform with
internet and the type of devices used for these activities.
Questions on section B were asked to determine participants’
knowledge on threat and concept. This section has total of 12
questions, which comprises of multiple choice questions and
ﬁve points Likert scale statements. Options for the ﬁve points
Likert scale statements ranging from Strongly Agree, Agree,
Don’t Know, Disagree and Strongly Disagree. In each of
the statement, either Strongly Agree and Agree or Disagree
and Strongly Disagree are considered as the correct option.
Section C seeks to verify the level of cyber-hygiene culture
exhibited by participants or their cyber-hygiene behaviour.
On section C, respondents were asked to report the degree
to which they engage on certain cyber-hygiene behaviour on
a four points Likert scale with option ranging from Every
time, Often, Rarely, and Never. In this case, either Every
time and Often or Never is considered as the correct option.
Questions in section B and C concentrates within the four
chosen aspects of cyber-hygiene (storage and virus, social
network, authentication and social engineering) used for
this study. The respondents were asked to go through the
deﬁnition of some technical
terms such as cyber-hygiene,
virus, authentication, social network and social engineering
used in the study for clariﬁcation, easy understanding and
better response.

According to [13],

the test of statistical hypotheses is
one of the main areas of statistical inference. Version 20 of
the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) software
was used for the analysis. Chi-square test, an analytical
tool embedded in Statistical Packages for Social Sciences
(SPSS) software was used to test the signiﬁcance of these
demographic variables. Also, multiple regression technique
was subsequently used to determine the direction of the main
impacts of the independent variables on the dependent one.
Out of these tests, the following inferences made on this
paper were drawn.

IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
This research survey sought to ﬁnd out from the participants
the type of devices they use for internet, the activities they use
internet for, their knowledge of cyber-hygiene concepts and
threats, and their cyber-hygiene behaviour. Our ﬁndings are
shown as tables and discussed in the following sections below:

A. Devices Used for the Internet

As shown in Table I, it was found that majority of the
respondents, 135(93.1%) indicated mobile phone as the most
commonly used device, followed by laptop 103(71%). The
least used is other devices 2(1.4%), followed by desktop
17(11.7%) and ﬁnally, Tablet with 21(14.5%). This varies
from the result in [14], where the number of laptop users are
more than the number of smart phone users. This may not be
far from the low cost of mobile phones and its proliferation
across the country compared to laptops.

B. Uses of Internet

Table II shows various purposes for which the participants
use internet for. It can be drawn from the table that apart from
playing games with only 23.4% (34, n=145), other purposes
in which the participants use the internet for attracts high
percentage of users ranging from 50.3 to 94.5. The highest
is internet browsing with 94.5% (137, n=145), followed by
learning with 86.9% (126, n=145). This ﬁndings show high
level of adoption and usage of internet among students and
employees of higher institutions, which calls for survey of
their cyber-hygiene knowledge and behaviour.

Demographics of Respondents From the demographic
information presented in Table III, the age of the respondents
were coded into ﬁve groups, respondents between 15-24years,
25-34year, 35-44years, 45-54years and above 54years. The
distributions of
respondents within these groups are as
follows: 15-24years 40.7% (59, n=145), 25-34year 25.5%
(37, n=145), 35-44years 20.0% (29, n=145), 45-54years
11.0% (16, n=145) and above 54years 2.8% (4, n=145). As
regards their educational level of the respondents, 0.7% (1)
has diploma, 44.1% (64) are undergraduates, 21.4% (31) are
graduates, 20.0% (29) are Masters degree holders and 13.8%
(20) have Doctorate degree.

D. Age and Cyber hygiene

In order to ﬁnd out the effect of the age of the participants
on cyber-hygiene, chi-square tests were carried out to check
the relationship between age and cyber-hygiene knowledge
and also between age and cyber-hygiene behaviour. From
the result of the chi-square test to determine the relationship
between age and cyber-hygiene as shown in Table IV, the
p-value of (0.455), which is greater than 0.05 indicates no
statistical signiﬁcance. This means that there is no relationship
between age and cyber-hygiene knowledge. On the same
hand, Table V presents a p-value of 0.551 for age and
cyber-hygiene behaviour, meaning that age of the participants
has no relationship with the cyber-hygiene behaviour. The
result here conforms to what was obtained in- [14].

E. Level of Education and Cyber hygiene

Chi-square tests were also conducted in two categories
to determine the relationship between level of education as
an independent variable and the dependent variable, cyber-
hygiene. In the ﬁrst category, the p-value of the chi-square
test for level of education and cyber-hygiene knowledge as
shown in Table VI is 0.628. The interpretation is that the level
of education of the respondent does not have relationship
with cyber-hygiene knowledge. Secondly,
the chi-square
test for level of education and cyber-hygiene behaviour has
p-value of 0.285 as shown in Table VII. This also means that
there is no relationship between the level of education of the

respondents and cyber-hygiene behaviour.

F. Percentage Representation of Good Knowledge and Good
Behaviour

Tables VIII and IX show the descriptive statistics of good
knowledge scores and good behaviour score respectively. This
was done to ﬁnd out if the data is normally distributed, that
is, if the median is the same as the mean. There are other
tests used for normality but are not included here. Both tables
show that data are normally distributed. That is it failed the
tests. So, the median was used as the cut off point for the
categorisation of the respondents into those with poor and
good knowledge, and poor and good behaviour. Those who
had a score of 10 and above had good knowledge, while
those with lower than 10 score were grouped as having poor
knowledge. The median for cyber-hygiene behaviour score is
6, therefore, those who had a score of 6 and above had good
behaviour, while those with lower than 6 score were grouped
as having poor behaviour. As shown in Table X, the number
of the respondents with good knowledge is 78, representing
53.79%, while 75 have good behaviour, that is 71.72%. This
result shows that a reasonable number of the respondents,
almost half, do neither have good cyber-hygiene knowledge
nor good cyber-hygiene behaviour.

V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
The primary target of our study was to determine the effect
of age and educational level on the cyber-hygiene knowledge
of employees and students of University of Nigeria, Nsukka,
through an online pilot study. Thus,
the detailed ﬁndings
of the research were presented in the result and discussion
section of our paper. From the results we have, it was found
that the two variables: age and level of education do not
have signiﬁcant effect on the cyber-hygiene knowledge and
behaviour of students and employees of University of Nigeria,
Nsukka. It was also discovered that a reasonable proportion
of the participants of this survey have poor cyber-hygiene
knowledge and behaviour, which suggests the need for proper
awareness and training.

The result of our ﬁndings as regards the effect of age on
cyber-hygiene correlates with the result in obtained in [14],
which also found that age has no statistical signiﬁcance with
cyber-hygiene. Based on the ﬁndings from this research, it can
be recommended that well focused training on cyber-hygiene
best practices should be organised for both students and
the internet
employees of
the tertiary institutions. Also,
security units of tertiary institutions should put
in place
adequate security infrastructures to safeguard the institution’s
information and devices against cyber-attacks.

VI. FUTURE WORK
In future study, the effect of other factors such as gender,
level of exposure, area of discipline that might impact on the

6

cyber-hygiene will be investigated. One major limitation of
this study was poor responses occasioned by closed down of
institutions because of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic.
