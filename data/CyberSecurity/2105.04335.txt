Abstract. Undetectable attacks are an important class of malicious attacks threatening the
security of cyber-physical systems, which can modify a system’s state but leave the system output
measurements unaﬀected, and hence cannot be detected from the output. This paper studies un-
detectable attacks on cone-invariant systems and multi-agent systems. We ﬁrst provide a general
characterization of zero-dynamics attacks, which characterizes fully undetectable attacks targeting
the non-minimum phase zeros of a system. This geometrical characterization makes it possible to
develop a defense strategy seeking to place a minimal number of sensors to detect and counter the
zero-dynamics attacks on the system’s actuators. The detect and defense scheme amounts to com-
puting a set containing potentially vulnerable actuator locations and nodes, and a defense union for
feasible placement of sensors based on the geometrical properties of the cones under consideration.

Key words. Undetectable attacks; sensor placement; defense strategy; cone-invariant systems;

multi-agent systems.

1. Introduction. Cyber-physical systems (CPS), networked and enabled by to-
day’s ubiquitous information technology (IT) infrastructure, have been widely re-
garded as new-generation engineered systems integrated by physical plants, control
and communication networks, and computational units. The technological, economic,
and societal impact of such systems is vastly expanding due to rapidly increasing net-
work interconnections of diﬀerent components, such as sensors, actuators, control
processing units, and communication devices. Much to our chagrin, however, inter-
connected network and computing devices expose the vulnerability of CPS and open
the door to potential cyber threats. Malicious attackers can gain access to sensing
and actuating devices to launch attacks through IT components, which is likely to
compromise the safe and reliable operation of a CPS and, in an extreme scenario, lead
to catastrophic consequences [1].

In light of the ever-increasing presence and ever-expanding scope of CPS, there
have been growing needs to address challenges in detecting attack threats, mitigat-
ing the impact of attacks, and designing eﬀective defense strategies. Of particular
relevance to this paper are a class of attacks that can be broadly referred to as
undetectable attacks. In [2], false data injection attacks were considered for static
systems, which inject false, ill-attempted data into the system. Stealthy deception at-
tacks, which alter sensor readings to avoid detection and cause damage, were studied

in [3]. Replay attacks [4] record the system’s operating data and fake the past data
as the current operating signal to drive the system. Zero-dynamics attacks target the
transmission zeros of the system and hide in the output [5]. Covert attacks exploit de-
coupling structures to deceive the controller by interrupting the input and the output
simultaneously [6].

While as alluded to above various undetectable attacks have been designed, the
work on the detection and prevention of such attacks has been scarce. Generally,
the detection of an attack can be done by inserting additional signals so as to per-
turb the system’s operating data, or by adding additional sensors, so as to change
the system’s structure and dynamics. For example, it was shown in [4] that adding
a Gaussian signal unknown to the attacker into communication channels can make
replay attacks detectable, and in [7], that by placing sensors on all neighbors of the
potential attacked nodes, zero-dynamics attacks can be prevented. Nevertheless, one
should note that adding a large number of sensors may neither be eﬀective nor feasi-
ble in many situations, especially in a distributed setting, because of environmental
constraints and cost-eﬃcient considerations. As such, where possible, more eﬃcient
defense strategies with a reasonable number of sensors are called for.

In this paper we study zero-dynamics attacks and their detection, in both a
single-loop cone-invariant system and multi-agent system conﬁguration. We provide
a general mathematical view of such attacks on cone-invariant linear time-invariant
(LTI) systems. Zero-dynamics attacks have been previously investigated in [5, 7, 8,
9, 10]. These attacks typically attack the system actuators while hidden from the
sensors of the system. As an example, when the system contains a real non-minimum
phase zero s0, a zero-dynamics attack can be designed in the form [5] of

d(t) = −es0td0.

This attack signal can alter the system’s state response but is unobserved from the
system output. In this paper, we present a general zero-dynamics attack conﬁguration,
where we show that more generally, non-minimum phase complex zeros can also be
subjected to zero attacks.

Our more signiﬁcant developments are devoted to the detection and prevention
of zero-dynamics attacks. Via a geometrical framework, we show that for LTI cone-
invariant systems, zero-dynamics attacks can be detected, or a system can be made
resistive to such attacks, by developing an eﬃcient sensor placement strategy. While
seemingly a mathematical notion, cone-invariant systems encompass many systems
of practical interest. One particular instance corresponds to positive systems, whose
states form an invariant positive cone. Positive systems have many applications,
e.g., in modeling growth behaviors of economical systems, ecological systems, popula-
tion dynamics, and more generally, dynamic systems involving positivity constraints
[11, 12]. Recently, positive systems have been used to model power grids, traﬃc ﬂow,
communication/computation networks, as well as production planning and logistics
[13]. Another case of interest is Lyapunov and Riccati diﬀerential equations, which
constitute a positive semi-deﬁnite cone in the space of Hermitian matrices [14]. Fi-
nally, cone-invariance with respect to polyhedral cones and ellipsoidal cones are also
of interest and have been considered in [15, 16].

In this paper, for cone-invariant systems and multi-agent systems [17, 18], we de-
velop a uniﬁed defense framework against zero-dynamics attacks. This is accomplished
by characterizing a vulnerable set containing potential positions or nodes where at-
tacks may get into the system, and meanwhile by constructing a defensive union
including feasible sensor placements based on the geometric properties of the cones

under consideration. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. In Section 2,
we provide a mathematical background on convex cones and systems that are cone-
invariant. In Section 3, we provide a general characterization of zero-dynamics attacks
on LTI systems, which enables us to fully characterize all possible attacks utilizing
the knowledge of a system’s non-minimum phase zeros. Based on this characteri-
zation, we develop in Section 4 defense strategies for cone-invariant systems, which
amount to placing a minimal number of sensors to counter zero-dynamics attacks on
the system’s actuators. Section 5 then extends the results to multi-agent systems, in
which undetectable attacks are launched on certain nodes of the multi-agent systems
and the defense is implemented at other nodes. Section 6 discusses generalizations
to multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems that are subject to multiple attacks.
Section 7 presents numerical studies on a microgrid power network under attack, to
illustrate our defense strategies. This paper concludes in Section 8.

2. Mathematical Preliminaries.

2.1. Convex Cones.
Definition 2.1. A nonempty set K ⊂ Rn is said to be a convex cone if K+K ⊂ K

and aK ⊂ K for all a ≥ 0.

We deﬁne the set −K = {x : −x ∈ K}. A convex cone K is said to be pointed if
K ∩ −K = {0} and solid if int K, i.e., the interior of K, is nonempty. The boundary
of K is denoted as ∂K. Moreover, a closed, pointed, and solid convex cone is called a
proper cone. A proper cone induces a partial order in Rn, that is, ∀x, y ∈ Rn, y (cid:22) x
if and only if x − y ∈ K. Hereafter, unless otherwise speciﬁed, all cones we mention
will be proper cones.

Herein, we brieﬂy survey some typical and representative cones [11, 19, 20].

• A polyhedral cone represents the intersection of ﬁnitely many closed half spa-
ces, each containing the origin on its boundary. Every polyhedral cone inter-
sected by k closed half spaces can be described mathematically as

K = (cid:8)x ∈ Rn : Ax ≥+ 0, A ∈ Rk×n(cid:9) ,

where ≥+ represents the element-wise order. When k = n and A = In, then
K = Rn
+ denotes the nonnegative orthant, which is also called positive cone.
• A positive semi-deﬁnite (PSD) cone is one that consists of positive semi-

deﬁnite matrices, i.e.,

+ = (cid:8)X ∈ S n : v(cid:62)Xv ≥ 0, ∀v ∈ Rn(cid:9) ,
S n
where S n ∈ Rn×n denotes the set of n × n real symmetric matrices. A PSD
cone S n
+ can be equivalently described in the n(n + 1)/2-dimensional vector
space, consisting of the elements of all positive semi-deﬁnite matrices on the
main diagonal and above it.
• An ellipsoidal cone is deﬁned as

K = (cid:8)x ∈ Rn : x(cid:62)Qx ≤ 0, l(cid:62)

n x ≥ 0(cid:9) ,

where Q ∈ S n has inertia1 (n − 1, 0, 1) and ln is a unit eigenvector of Q
corresponding to the negative eigenvalue. When Q = Qn = diag {−1, In−1}

1The inertia of a real symmetric matrix is a triple of the number of positive eigenvalues, zero

eigenvalues, and negative eigenvalues.

Given a cone K in Rn, its dual cone is deﬁned as

K∗ = {y ∈ Rn : (cid:104)x, y(cid:105) ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ K},
where (cid:104) , (cid:105) denotes a pre-deﬁned inner product. A cone K is said to be self-dual if
K = K∗. For instance, Rn
+ and Ln
+ are self-dual cones endowed with the standard
inner product (cid:104)x, y(cid:105) = x(cid:62)y, and S n
+ is a self-dual cone endowed with the inner product
(cid:104)X, Y (cid:105) = Tr (XY ). One useful lemma reveals the geometric relationship between each
entry in K and its corresponding K∗ [11].

Lemma 2.2. For a cone K and its dual cone K∗, it holds that (cid:104)y, x(cid:105) > 0, ∀ y ∈

int K∗, x ∈ K.

2.2. Matrices. In the sequel, matrices characterizing the invariance with respect

to given cones will be studied.

Definition 2.3. For a cone K, a matrix A ∈ Rn×n is called a K-invariant matrix

if AK ⊂ K.

Denote by π(K) the set of cone-invariant matrices over K. For example, any
+-invariant matrix. Any matrix A = B⊗B, ∀B ∈
+-invariant matrix, where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product. The matrix

nonnegative matrix A ∈ Rn×n is an Rn
Rn×n, is an S n
A ∈ Rn×n is an Ln

+-invariant matrix if it satisﬁes the relation

1 ∈ Ln

+, A(cid:62)QnA − δQn (cid:22) 0,

for some δ ∈ R, where a1 is the ﬁrst row of A and (cid:22) is deﬁned on S n

+ [21].

Definition 2.4. A matrix A ∈ π(K) is said to be K-positive if A(K\{0}) ⊂ intK.

Denote by π+(K) the set of K-positive matrices.

Except for cone-invariant matrices, cross-positive matrices (exponential cone-

invariant matrices) are also introduced herein [22].

Definition 2.5. For a cone K and its dual cone K∗, a matrix A ∈ Rn×n is called
cross-positive over K if for all x ∈ K, y ∈ K∗ such that (cid:104)y, x(cid:105) = 0, it holds that
(cid:104)y, Ax(cid:105) ≥ 0.

matrices [11]. Any matrix A = B ⊕ B, ∀B ∈ Rn×n, is cross-positive over S n
⊕ denotes the Kronecker sum. The matrix A ∈ Rn×n is cross-positive over Ln

A(cid:62)Qn + QnA − ξQn (cid:22) 0

for some ξ ∈ R [19], where (cid:22) is deﬁned on S n
+.
Diﬀerent from the conventional irreducibility2 of a matrix, the cone-irreducibility

of cross-positive matrices is deﬁned below [11, 22].

Definition 2.6. A matrix A ∈ (cid:36)(K) is said to be K-irreducible if no eigenvector

of A lies on the boundary of K.

Denote by (cid:36)(cid:48)(K) the set of K-irreducible cross-positive matrices.

Remark 2.7. From [23], for any matrix A ∈ (cid:36)(Rn

+), the Rn

+-irreducibility and the

conventional matrix irreducibility are equivalent.

Moreover, when A ∈ π(K), there exists another equivalent deﬁnition of matrix

cone-irreducibility in terms of the face of the cone.

Definition 2.8. Let F ⊆ K be a pointed closed cone. Then F is called a face of

K if ∀x ∈ F,

0 (cid:22) y (cid:22) x ⇒ y ∈ F,

where (cid:22) is deﬁned on K. The face F is said to be nontrivial if F (cid:54)= {0} and F (cid:54)= K.
Definition 2.9. A matrix A ∈ π(K) is said to be K-irreducible if the only faces

of K leaving invariant with A are {0} or K itself.

Denote by π(cid:48)(K) the set of K-irreducible cone-invariant matrices. Then the following
relations are known [22].

Lemma 2.10.

π+(K) ⊆ π(cid:48)(K) ⊆ π(K).

The following lemma, adapted from [11], on cross-positive matrices will be useful

in the sequel.

Lemma 2.11. Let spectrum(A) be the set of eigenvalues of A.

If A ∈ (cid:36)(K), then
1) µ = max{Re (δ) : δ ∈ spectrum(A)} is an eigenvalue of A,
2) K and K∗ contain right- and left-eigenvectors of A associated with the eigenvalue
µ.
If A ∈ (cid:36)(cid:48)(K), then
3) µ = max{Re (δ) : δ ∈ spectrum(A)} is a simple eigenvalue of A,
4) int K and int K∗ contain right- and left-eigenvectors of A associated with the eigen-
value µ.

Note that Lemma 2.11 reduces to the Krein-Rutman theorem if A ∈ π(K), and

furthermore, to the well-known Perron-Frobenius theorem if A ∈ π(Rn

+) [11].

2.3. Cone-Invariant Systems. Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) system

with input u(t) ∈ R, output y(t) ∈ R, and state x(t) ∈ Rn, with realization

(2.1)

˙x(t) = Ax(t) + bu(t),
y(t) = c(cid:62)x(t).

We say that this system is cone-invariant over a cone K if x(t) ∈ K and y(t) ≥ 0
whenever x(0) ∈ K and u(t) ≥ 0 for t ≥ 0. Equivalently, the following lemma reveals
the relations of the system’s cone-invariance to the triple (A, b, c(cid:62)) [24, 25].

Lemma 2.12. The LTI system (2.1) is a cone-invariant system over K if and only

if

A ∈ (cid:36)(K), b ∈ K, and c ∈ K∗.
+, or K = Ln

When K = Rn

+, K = S n

+, the related cone-invariant system reduces to
a positive system, a dynamic covariance system, or a Lorentz cone-invariant system,
respectively, which all possess rich theoretical features and broad applications [13, 14,
26].

In the remainder of the paper, we study cone-invariant systems over a general
cone K. We examine the behavior of such systems under undetectable attacks and
construct accordingly a defense mechanism to counter the attacks. We consider cone-
invariant systems that are Hurwitz stable; in other words, the systems are stable in
the absence of attacks.

3. Undetectable Attacks. Consider a MIMO LTI system

(3.1)

˙x(t) = Ax(t) + Bd(t),

y(t) = Cx(t),

with output measurement y(t) ∈ Rl excited by the initial state x(0) ∈ Rn and a
malicious attack d(t) ∈ Rm. Throughout this paper, from (3.1), we address the
scenario where the attacks are launched on the system’s actuators. We denote the
system output as y(t) = y(x(0), d(t), t). An intuitive interpretation of undetectable
attacks is that such an attack will result in the same output as that in the absence of
attacks [5], and hence cannot be detected from output measurement.

6

This manuscript is for review purposes only.

Definition 3.1. An attack d(t) ∈ Rm on the system (3.1) is undetectable if the

system output satisﬁes the relation

(3.2)

y(x(0) − ˜x(0), d(t), t) = 0, ∀ t ≥ 0,

for some x(0) and ˜x(0).

Here x(0) and ˜x(0) are understood to be the system’s actual initial state and an attack
initial condition. Hence, the design of an undetectable attack amounts to ﬁnding a
input d(t) that, when coordinating with the initial state x(0) − ˜x(0), yields a zero
output.

Lemma 3.2. For the system (3.1), the attack signal

(3.3)

d(t) = −es0td0, s0 ∈ R, d0 ∈ Rm

is undetectable if and only if there exists a vector ζ (cid:54)= 0 such that

(3.4)

(cid:20)s0I − A B
0
C

(cid:21) (cid:20) ζ
d0

(cid:21)

= 0.

Here the attack initial condition can be obtained by ˜x(0) = x(0) − ζ. It is rather clear
that the attack (3.3) is undetectable if and only if s0 is a real transmission zero of
the system, and hence is also referred to as a zero-dynamics attack. Then a natural
question is how to construct a real attack signal cooperated with a real attack initial
condition to attack the system with complex transmission zeros? This is answered in
the following theorem.

Theorem 3.3. For the system (3.1), the attack signal

(3.5)

d(t) = −l1Re (cid:0)es0td0

(cid:1) − l2Im (cid:0)es0td0

(cid:1) , s0 ∈ C, d0 ∈ Cm, ∀ l1, l2 ∈ R,

coordinated with

(3.6)

˜x(0) = x(0) − (l1Re (ζ) + l2Im (ζ))

is undetectable if and only if there exists a vector ζ (cid:54)= 0 such that the equation (3.4)
is satisﬁed.
Note that for a zero s0 ∈ R, the undetectable attack (3.5) reduces to that in (3.3).

Proof. Denote d0 = d1 + d2j, s0 = α + βj and ζ = x1 + x2j. The attack signal

(3.5) can thus be rewritten as

d(t) = eαt(sin(βt)l1d2 − cos(βt)l1d1 − sin(βt)l2d1 − cos(βt)l2d2)

= eαt(sin(βt)(l1d2 − l2d1) − cos(βt)(l1d1 + l2d2)).

For the initial state, it holds that x(0) − ˜x(0) = l1x1 + l2x2. Also, the real and
imaginary parts of the equation (3.4) are obtained as

(3.7)

(αI − A)x1 − βx2 + Bd1 = 0,
(αI − A)x2 + βx1 + Bd2 = 0,

where Cx1 = 0, and Cx2 = 0. Denote the Laplace transforms of d(t) and y(t) by D(s)
and Y (s). Therefore,

D(s) =

β

(s − α)2 + β2 (l1d2 − l2d1) −

s − α

(βl2 + (s − α)l1)
(s − α)2 + β2 d1

+ C(sI − A)−1(l1x1 + l2x2).

In addition, together with (3.7), it follows that

Y (s) = −C(sI − A)−1 (βl1 − (s − α)l2)
(s − α)2 + β2

((αI − A)x2 + βx1)

((s − α)l1 + βl2)

((s − α)l2 − βl1)
(s − α)2 + β2 Cx2 = 0.

We conclude that y(x(0) − ˜x(0), d(t), t) = 0, and the proof is completed.

We conclude this section by commenting on zero-dynamics attacks on cone-
invariant systems. Note that when restricting general LTI systems to cone-invariant
systems over a cone K, because of the cone-invariance additionally required, the def-
inition of undetectable attacks, in comparison to Deﬁnition 3.1, should be modiﬁed
accordingly as follows. Speciﬁcally, we say that an attack d(t) ∈ R is undetectable
on the cone-invariant system (2.1) over a cone K if Deﬁnition 3.1 is satisﬁed, and
additionally the state in (2.1) satisﬁes the invariance condition x(t) ∈ K, ∀ t ≥ 0.
In other words, for cone-invariant systems, not only the attack cannot be observed
at the output of the system, but also the cone-invariance property of the system
must be preserved. Clearly, both the attacks d(t) in (3.3) and (3.5) are unobserved
at the output. To ensure that the condition x(t) ∈ K is valid, it is necessary that
d(t) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0, which can be satisﬁed for the attack d(t) in (3.3) by letting d0 < 0.
On the other hand, the attack d(t) in (3.5) cannot be kept nonnegative since it is
a linear combination of sinusoidal signals. Consequently, for a stable cone-invariant
system (2.1), only the attack d(t) in (3.3) is still undetectable.

4. Sensor Placement. In light of the discussion at the end of section 3, in this
section, we develop a detection strategy to cope with undetectable attacks d(t) =
−es0td0, on the non-minimum phase zeros s0 ≥ 0 of stable cone-invariant systems.

4.1. Protection via Sensor Placement. We consider a single zero-dynamics
attack, that is, the attack enters the system through one actuator or one node. Here
without loss of generality, we take b ∈ {ei, i = 1, . . . , n} to represent the accessibility
of the attack to the system, where ei is the ith Euclidean coordinate. To characterize
the available attacked positions in cone-invariant systems, we make the following
assumption.

8

This manuscript is for review purposes only.

Assumption 1. The set ΛK = {ei : ei ∈ K} is nonempty.

The set ΛK characterizes all accessible positions for potential attackers. The cardi-
nality of ΛK varies with the choice of K. For example,

(4.1)

ΛRn
+

= {ei, i = 1, . . . , n} ,

ΛS n

+

= {vec(diag(ei)), i = 1, . . . , n} , and ΛLn

+

= {e1}.

Clearly, for these cones, ΛK is not empty. Analogously, we also assume that the set
{ej : ej ∈ K∗} is nonempty.

In the rest of this paper, we seek defense approaches by designing c to prevent
undetectable attacks. In general, adding a large number of sensors implies an eﬀective
defensive strategy. More precisely, by the PBH test [27], the system’s observability
implies that x(0) = ˜x(0), and hence bd(t) = 0, ∀ t ≥ 0, that is, the undetectable
attack is non-existent. Nevertheless, this approach is clearly not a cost-eﬃcient way,
especially for large-scale and distributed systems. Recalling from Lemma 3.2 the
condition for the attack d(t) = −es0td0, it is clear that a defensive strategy is successful
if it can block all non-minimum phase zeros of the given system.

Definition 4.1. We say that a defense strategy, namely a design of c, is (almost)

successful if one of the following conditions holds:

(i) R

(ii) R

(cid:21)(cid:19)

(cid:18)(cid:20)s0I − A b
c(cid:62)
0
(cid:18)(cid:20)s0I − A b
(cid:21)(cid:19)
c(cid:62)
0

= n + 1,

< n + 1 and d0 = 0,

for each s0 with (s0 > 0) s0 ≥ 0. Here R denotes the rank of a matrix.

For s0 ≥ 0, the condition (i) indicates that by designing an appropriate c, s0
is not a non-minimum phase zero of system, while the condition (ii), via PBH test,
means that s0 as a non-minimum phase zero is also an unobservable mode of the
system. For s0 = 0 with d0 (cid:54)= 0, the corresponding attack d(t) = d0 as a constant
signal cannot make the states of a stable system divergent. Hence we call a strategy
is almost successful if the above conditions can be satisﬁed only for s0 > 0.

4.2. Sensor Placement Strategy. In this section, we concentrate on the case
with a single measurement, i.e., c ∈ {ei, i = 1, . . . , n}, as a defense strategy to achieve,
apparently, the minimal cost. Then we obtain a collective set containing all c that
can enable a successful defense.

Theorem 4.2. Given a stable cone-invariant system (2.1) over a cone K, for an
undetectable attack (3.3) with ∀b ∈ ΛK, the defense strategy with ∀c ∈ Π is successful,
where Π = {ej : ej ∈ int K∗}. Moreover, if A ∈ (cid:36)(cid:48)(K), then Π = {ej : ej ∈ K∗}.

To establish Theorem 4.2, we need the following lemma.
Lemma 4.3. Given a Hurwitz stable matrix A and a cone K, for each s0 ≥ 0,
(s0I − A)−1 is a cone-invariant matrix, i.e., (s0I − A)−1 ∈ π(K) if and only if A is
a cross-positive matrix over K, i.e., A ∈ (cid:36)(K).

Proof. Suﬃciency. Consider a stable system ˙x(t) = Ax(t) with A ∈ (cid:36)(K). If
x(0) ∈ K, through the cone-invariance, we have x(t) ∈ K, ∀ t ≥ 0. After taking the
Laplace transform, it follows that X(s) = (sI − A)−1x(0). For each s0 ≥ 0, since A
is stable, it is larger than the radius of convergence of the Laplace transform, which
implies that X(s) does converge at point s0. From X(s0) = (cid:82) ∞
0 x(t)e−s0tdt, together
with the facts that x(t) ∈ K and e−s0t > 0, it is easy to see that X(s0) ∈ K, ∀ s0 ≥ 0.

Therefore, for ∀ x(0) ∈ K, we have X(s0) = (s0I − A)−1x(0) ∈ K, which points out
that (s0I − A)−1 ∈ π(K).

Necessity. For s0 = 0, it can be easily veriﬁed that A ∈ (cid:36)(K) if −A−1 ∈ π(K).
For s0 > 0, since (s0I − A)−1 ∈ π(K), it follows that (I − 1
A)−1 ∈ π(K). According
s0
to Deﬁnition 2.5, we deﬁne f (k) = (cid:10)y, (I − kA)−1x(cid:11), where x ∈ K, y ∈ K∗ such that
(cid:104)y, x(cid:105) = 0. Clearly, it holds that f (0) = 0. In addition, since (I − kA)−1x ∈ K and
y ∈ K∗, it follows that f (k) ≥ 0, ∀ k > 0. Hence, denote ˙f (k) as the ﬁrst derivative of
f (k). We have ˙f (0) ≥ 0. On the other hand, after calculating ˙f (k), we obtain

˙f (k) = (cid:10)y, (I − kA)−1A(I − kA)−1x(cid:11) ,

Thus, we have ˙f (0) = (cid:104)y, Ax(cid:105) ≥ 0. The matrix A is cross-positive over K, i.e., A ∈
(cid:36)(K).

Now, we are ready to prove Theorem 4.2.

Proof. For s0 ≥ 0, since A is stable, the matrix s0I − A has full rank and is

invertible. Then,

.

The matrix above is full rank if and only if c(cid:62)(s0I − A)−1b (cid:54)= 0 with ∀s0 ≥ 0, ∀ b ∈ Λ,
and ∀ c ∈ Π.

At ﬁrst, by Lemma 4.3, we have (s0I − A)−1 ∈ π(K). Since b ∈ ΛK ⊆ K, it follows
that (s0I − A)−1b ∈ K. In light of Lemma 2.2, we claim that c(cid:62)(s0I − A)−1b > 0
with ∀ c ∈ {ej : ej ∈ int K∗}.

Consider the case A ∈ (cid:36)(cid:48)(K) and c ∈ {ej : ej ∈ K∗}. From Deﬁnition 2.4, if
(s0I − A)−1 is a K-positive matrix, i.e., (s0I − A)−1 ∈ π+(K), we have (s0I − A)−1b ∈
intK, and thus c(cid:62)(s0I − A)−1b > 0 with the help of Lemma 2.2. Hence, we need to
verify that (s0I − A)−1 ∈ π+(K) with A ∈ (cid:36)(cid:48)(K) and ∀s0 ≥ 0.

Assume that there exists ¯s0 ≥ 0 such that (¯s0I − A)−1 /∈ π+(K), then there exist
l ∈ K − {0} and p ∈ ∂K such that p = (¯s0I − A)−1l, i.e., l = (¯s0I − A)p. Choose
q ∈ K∗ such that (cid:104)q, p(cid:105) = 0. It follows that (cid:104)q, Ap(cid:105) ≥ 0. Therefore, we have

0 ≤ (cid:104)q, l(cid:105) = (cid:104)q, (¯s0I − A)p(cid:105) = ¯s0 (cid:104)q, p(cid:105) − (cid:104)q, Ap(cid:105) ≤ 0,

indicating (cid:104)q, l(cid:105) = 0, and then l ∈ ∂K. Given ¯s1 > ¯s0, denote w = (¯s1I − A)p =
(¯s1 − ¯s0)p + l, we have w ∈ K. Furthermore, it follows that w ∈ ∂K since

(cid:104)q, w(cid:105) = (¯s1 − ¯s0) (cid:104)q, p(cid:105) + (cid:104)q, l(cid:105) = 0.

In light of [23], we can construct the face Fw of K generated by w with

Fω = {x : ax (cid:22) w, ∃a > 0} ,

where (cid:22) is deﬁned on K. Since w = (¯s1 − ¯s0)p + l (cid:54)= 0, ∀x ∈ Fw ⊆ K, we have

This manuscript is for review purposes only.

We obtain that (cid:104)q, x(cid:105) = 0 and x ∈ ∂K. According to Deﬁnition 2.8, the face Fw is
nontrivial. Next, we can obtain that

which yields that Fw is invariant with respect to (¯s1I − A)−1, so is to (¯s0I − A)−1.
According to Deﬁnition 2.8 and 2.9, it can be shown that (¯s0I − A)−1 /∈ π(cid:48)(K). In
addition, by Deﬁnition 2.6, we can verify the existence of an eigenvector of (¯s0I −A)−1
located on ∂K, so is to A since (¯s0I − A)−1 and A share the same eigenvectors, which
therefore leads to contradiction. Hence, if A is a K-irreducible matrix, (s0I − A)−1 is
a K-positive matrix for any s0 ≥ 0.

It is worth emphasizing that existing works mainly focus on the protection of
static systems, like power systems, in which undetectable attacks should hide in the
kernel space of the studied matrix, projecting attack signals into the measurement
residual. This work extends this protection scheme into dynamic systems and prevents
undetectable attacks corresponding to non-minimum phase zeros.

4.3. Marginally Stable Cone-Invariant System. An LTI system is marginally
stable if and only if the real part of every eigenvalue of the matrix A is non-positive
and at least one simple eigenvalue is located on the imaginary axis. In this section,
we extend the preceding defensive strategies to marginally stable systems.

Theorem 4.7. Given a marginally stable cone-invariant system (2.1) over a cone
K, if A ∈ (cid:36)(cid:48)(K), for an undetectable attack (3.3) with ∀b ∈ ΛK, the defense strategy
with ∀c ∈ Π is successful, where Π = {ej : ej ∈ K∗} .

Proof. For s0 > 0, the proof is technically similar to that for Theorem 4.2, thus,
omitted. For s0 = 0, in light of Lemma 2.11, there exists a zero eigenvalue of A ∈
(cid:36)(cid:48)(K) and A is not invertible. Consider the matrix [s0 − A b ; c(cid:62) 0] = [−A ei ; e(cid:62)
j 0].
If ei /∈ Im(A) ∩ ΛK, we can easily verify that either the matrix [−A ei ; e(cid:62)
j 0] has full
rank or it is not full rank but d0 = 0, satisfying the conditions (i) and (ii) in Deﬁnition
4.1, respectively. Assume that there exists ei ∈ Im(A) ∩ ΛK, which also indicates a
vector ξ such that ei = Aξ. From Lemma 2.11, there exists a vector y ∈ int K∗
satisfying y(cid:62)A = 0. Therefore, it follows that

(cid:104)y, ei(cid:105) = (cid:104)y, Aξ(cid:105) = (cid:10)yA(cid:62), ξ(cid:11) = 0.

On the other hand, since y ∈ int K∗ and ei ∈ ΛK ∈ K, by Lemma 2.2, we have
(cid:104)y, ei(cid:105) > 0, which leads to contradiction.

5. Multi-Agent Systems. In this section, we consider sensor placement strate-
gies for multi-agent systems against undetectable attacks. We show that ﬁrst-order
multi-agent systems can be formulated as a special case of marginally stable positive
systems, whereas second-order multi-agent systems are not. Nevertheless, the features
of positive cone Rn
+ still shed useful lights into the defense strategy of second-order
systems.

5.1. Algebraic Graph Theory. Let G = (V, E, A) denote a weighted digraph
with the set of agents (vertices or nodes) V = {v1, . . . , vn}, the set of edges (links)
E = V × V, and the weighted adjacency matrix A = (aij) with nonnegative elements
aij. An edge of G is denoted by (vi, vj) ∈ E if there exists a directed link from agent
vi to agent vj with weight aij > 0, i.e., agent vj can receive information from agent
vi. Denote Ni = {j ∈ V : (vj, vi) ∈ E} as the neighborhood set of node i. A path from
node v1 to node vk is a sequence of nodes v1, . . . , vk, such that for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k −1,
i = (cid:80)n
(vi, vi+1) is an edge. The in-degree of agent vi is deﬁned as degin
j=1 aij. Deﬁne
1 , . . . , degin
for the graph G the Laplacian matrix L = D − A, where D (cid:44) diag(degin
n ) is
the in-degree matrix. Its row sums equal to zero. Note that any negative Laplacian
matrix −L is a Metzler matrix, which is cross-positive over the positive cone Rn
+. And
it follows that L can be decomposed as L = αI − ¯L, where α = ρ( ¯L) is the spectral
radius of ¯L, and ¯L ∈ π(Rn

+).

Connectivity is one of the basic concepts in graph theory. A digraph is strongly
connected if it contains a directed path for every pair of vertices. Meanwhile, the
Laplacian matrix L is irreducible if and only if its corresponding digraph is strongly
connected. Diﬀerent from the strong connectivity, a weaker connectivity requires a
digraph to have a directed spanning tree, by which we mean that a certain agent vi
exists such that for any other agent, there is a directed path from vi to that agent.
The agent vi is called a root of the spanning tree. A digraph can be broken down
into strongly connected components and every component is a strongly connected
subgraph. Consider a digraph with M strongly connected components. The i-th
strongly connected component is denoted as SCCi, i = 1, . . . , M with ni nodes. The
Laplacian matrix in this case can be represented by a block triangular matrix, with a

connected components. The corresponding Laplacian matrix is given by

where x = [x1, . . . , xn](cid:62), and L is the Laplacian matrix of the corresponding digraph.
Note that this ﬁrst-order multi-agent system is a marginally stable cone-invariant
system over the positive cone Rn
+. When the digraph is strongly connected, in view of
Remark 2.7, L is irreducible and thus is Rn
+-irreducible. According to Theorem 4.7,
we have the following result immediately.

ening the strong connectivity requirement of the digraph in the following theorem.

where ξi ∈ R and ζi ∈ R are the corresponding states and ui ∈ R denotes the
distributed control law. Next, we extend our preceding sensor placement strategies
into second-order multi-agent systems which are not invariant with the positive cone
Rn
+. Before showing main results of this section, we provide the following lemma at
ﬁrst.

Lemma 5.3. For a Laplacian matrix L deﬁned on a strongly connected digraph,

we have ei /∈ Im(L) and ei /∈ Im(L(cid:62)), ∀ei, i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

Proof. We prove the lemma by contradiction. Assume that there exists ei such
that ei ∈ Im(A). Then we can obtain x (cid:54)= 0 satisfying ei = Lx. In light of Lemma
2.11, there exists a strictly positive vector v such that v(cid:62)L = 0.
It follows that
v(cid:62)ei = v(cid:62)Lx = 0, showing that the ith entry of v is zero. This fact contradicts with
the strict positivity of v. Also, the result ei /∈ Im(L(cid:62)) can be proved in a similar
manner.

Consider two general types of distributed control laws, respectively. The ﬁrst

class of distributed control law is designed as
(cid:88)

(5.7)

ui(t) = −kiζi(t) +

υi,j(ξj(t) − ξi(t)),

j∈Ni

where ki, υi,j > 0, ∀i, j = 1, . . . , N [28, 29]. One available physical interpretation of
ξi(t) and ζi(t) are the position and the velocity of the agent i in a mechanical system,
and ki can be interpreted as the radio of agent’s damper to mass. The agents under
the control law (5.7) move toward the position of their neighbors while damping their
current velocity [30]. The closed-loop system combining (5.6) and (5.7) under an
undetectable attack can be written as:

of the diagonal matrix K. As such, by noting that (cid:104)y, (−K − (1/s0)L)x(cid:105) ≥ 0, we

it is irreducible. We hence claim that all the entries of (cid:0)s0I + (s0I + rL)−1L(cid:1)−1
are
strictly positive.

For the case (iv), we consider the matrix I − s0(s2

Consider the case s0 = 0. In light of Lemma 5.3, in the case (ii), the associated
matrix (cid:2)−A, b; c(cid:62), 0(cid:3) has full rank. In the case (iii), the matrix is not full rank, but it
can be easily veriﬁed that d0 associated with s0 = 0 always equals to zero. Therefore,
for the attack with ∀b ∈ Λ2 (Λ1), any defense c located in the set Π is (almost)
successful.

In Theorem 5.5, it holds that Λ1 ∪ Λ2 = ΛR2n

. Therefore, together with Theorem
5.4, for both second-order multi-agent systems (5.8) and (5.13), all the potentially
vulnerable positions for undetectable attacks have been considered. At the same

time, an arbitrary single measurement in Π = {fi, i = 1, . . . , 2n} is successful to
prevent those attacks.

6. Further Discussion on MIMO Case. In the preceding sections, we pro-
posed a single-sensor placement strategy to defend a single attack. This strategy is
eﬀective for single-input, single-output (SISO) systems. We now discuss its extension
to MIMO systems.

Assume that multiple undetectable attacks enter the system through m channels.
Speciﬁcally, in the system (3.1), let B = [b1, . . . , bm] ∈ Rn×m, and C (cid:62) = [c1, . . . , cl] ∈
Rn×l, where bi, cj are the ith and jth Euclidean coordinates of Rn, respectively.
According to Deﬁnition 4.1, for the multiple attacks, the defense strategy will be
successful if and only if

(6.1)

R(C(s0I − A)−1B) = m

for each s0 with s0 ≥ 0. Apparently, for the extreme case such that m = l = n and
B = C = I, it yields that

R(C(s0I − A)−1B) = R((s0I − A)−1) = n.

That is, if all nodes and channels are placed by sensors, then even they all have been
attacked, the defense strategy is still successful. Nevertheless, if m (cid:28) n, together with
the cost-eﬃcient consideration, the complete sensor placement is indeed impractical.
Under this circumstance, we assume that m = l < n. The condition (6.1) can reduce
to

(6.2)

det(C(s0I − A)−1B) (cid:54)= 0,

∀s0 ≥ 0.

We use det to represent the matrix determinant. Diﬀerent from the SISO case con-
centrating on the entries of (s0I − A)−1, for the MIMO case, it requires us to study
the minors of (s0I − A)−1. The cut-down columns and rows are determined by the
matrices B and C.

As an example, we design defense strategy against multiple attacks over the ﬁrst-
order multi-agent system (5.4) ˙x(t) = −Lx(t) to demonstrate the highly increased
complexity from the SISO scenario to the MIMO one. From the condition (6.2), it is
necessary to examine det(C(s0I + L)−1B), ∀s0 > 0. Denote by IB, IC ⊆ {1, . . . , n}
the sets of integers with the cardinality m indexed by the matrices B and C. Then we
use (s0I + L)−1
to denote the submatrix of (s0I + L)−1 restricted to rows ordered
by C and columns ordered by B. From the Jacobi’s complementary minor formula
[33], it follows that det((s0I + L)−1
) (cid:54)= 0 if and only if det((s0I + L) ¯IB ¯IC ) (cid:54)= 0,
where ¯IB and ¯IC are the complementary sets of IB and IC. We add a ﬁctitious vertex
on the underlying digraph indexed by 0, where all other vertices point to the vertex
0 with the weight s0 on each new edge. The enlarged Laplacian matrix is noted as
ˆL ∈ R(n+1)×(n+1). Then it is straightforward that

IC IB

IC IB

det((s0I + L) ¯IB ¯IC ) = det( ˆL ¯IB ¯IC ).
Therefore, the target injection set and the sensor placement set should contain all
available sets IB and IC such that det( ˆL ¯IB ¯IC ) (cid:54)= 0, ∀s0 > 0. They can be solved
eﬀectively based on the underlying digraph’s structure in light of the all minors matrix
tree theorem [34]. Note that if the digraph is strongly connected and m = 1, we can
arrive at Corollary 5.1 directly from the matrix tree theorem.

In the next step, we will continue to extend our analysis to the multiple attacks

over more general cone-invariant systems in a progressive manner.

7. Examples. In this section, we use two power network models as examples
to illustrate our results, demonstrating how sensors may be placed to prevent un-
detectable attacks. We consider the decentralized voltage control schemes in inter-
connected buses over networks. Each bus can be controlled to regulate its voltage
magnitude and phase-angle independently. We refer to [32, 35] for the network mod-
els and the terminologies.

Example 7.1. In this example, we verify the result in Theorem 4.2 for positive
systems. We start by considering the voltage magnitude dynamics of the power net-
work that consists of a set of interconnected buses. Assume that the power network is
outﬁtted with n buses which are all inverter buses(microgrids). For bus i, its voltage
magnitude dynamics can be modeled by a single integrator

τi ˙Vi(t) = ui(t),

where τi > 0 is the inverter’s time-constant. Consider the voltage quadratic droop
controller [36] described by

ui(t) = −κiVi(t)(Vi(t) − V ∗

i (t)) − Qi(t),

where κi > 0, V ∗
power injection at bus i, respectively. The reactive power injection Qi is given by:

i , and Qi are the controller gain, the nominal voltage, and the reactive

Qi(t) = −

(cid:88)

j∈Ni

kij cos(θi(t) − θj(t)),

where kij = ViVjbij, bij is the susceptance of the power line between buses i and
j, and θi is the phase angle of bus i. Since all the phase angles are close, under
the standard decoupling approximation, it follows that cos(θi − θj) ≈ 1. Denoting
V = [V1, . . . , Vn](cid:62), τ = [τ1, . . . , τn](cid:62), and κ = [κ1, . . . , κn](cid:62). After the Jacobian
linearization around an equilibrium point ¯V , the state-space form (2.1) of the power
network’s voltage magnitude dynamics is given by the state x = V − ¯V and the system
matrix

A = −diag( ¯V )diag(τ )−1 (diag(κ) + BG) ,

where BG is the susceptance matrix over the underlying topology.

In Fig. 4, the solid lines indicate the trajectories initiated from x(0) = [12.5822

the attack d(t). In Fig. 5, there are the trajectories initiated from x(0) with (solid

asymptotic stability of the system.
In these ﬁgures, x(t), ˜x(t), and ˆx(t) represent
the normal state trajectories, the fraudulent state trajectories, and the attacked state
trajectories, respectively.

kij(θi(t) − θj(t)) = 0.

The 9-bus power network’s topological parameters are noted in Fig. 6. For simplicity,
we normalized the voltage magnitudes Vi = 1, ∀i, while the rest dynamic coeﬃcients
of the buses were arbitrarily taken from reasonable values. The phase-angle dynamics
of the power network can be rewritten in the state-space form (5.8) with the size
A ∈ R18×18. The system’s state is denoted by x = [θ1, . . . , θ9, ˙θ1, . . . , ˙θ9](cid:62). The
attacker’s target is speciﬁed as x1. We choose to measure x10 as the defense strategy,
which can be readily available through phase measurement units (PMU). The real
zeros of the system are 0 and −0.1123. For s0 = 0, the solution to (3.4) satisﬁes
d0 = 0. For s0 = −0.1123, one solution to the equation (3.4) is x(0) − ˜x(0) =

− 0.6939 − 0.6796 − 0.7743 − 0.8032](cid:62) and d0 = 0.7542, which implies the attack
signal d(t) = −0.7542e−0.1123t.

For the clarity, only the behaviors of buses 1,3, and 5 are recorded in ﬁgures. The
solid lines in Fig. 7 are the trajectories initiated from {xi(0), i = 1, 3, 5, 10, 12, 14}
with attack d(t), while the dot lines are initiated from {˜xi(0), i = 1, 3, 5, 10, 12, 14}.
Note that the outputs of these two cases (the cyan line) are exactly the same and the
undetectability is conﬁrmed. In Fig. 8, there are the trajectories initiated from xi(0)
with (solid lines) and without (dash lines) the attack d(t). The 9-bus power system
can still achieve synchronous with the attack d(t) while the ﬁnal synchronous points
of {xj(t), j = 1, 3, 5} are deﬂected.

developed in this paper. We have shown that for an undetectable attacks getting into
the system through any position in ΛK, any defense by placing one sensor in the
union Π is successful or almost successful. The sets ΛK and Π can be characterized
by the intersection of the canonical basis vectors and the cone K or its dual cone K∗,
which are easily computable from a geometric perspective. For multi-agent systems
with single- and double-integrator dynamics, we show that if the associated digraph
is strongly connected, the corresponding sets ΛK and Π will both contain all nodes in
the digraph.
