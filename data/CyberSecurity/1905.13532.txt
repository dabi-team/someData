Abstract  —  Recent  years  have  shown  us  the  importance  of 
cybersecurity.  Especially,  when  the    matter    is    national  
security,  it  is  even  more  essential  and  crucial.  Increasing  
cyber attacks,  especially  between  countries  in  governmental  
level,    created    a    new    term  cyber  warfare.    Creating    some  
rules    and    regulations    for    this    kind    of    war    is    necessary  
therefore  international  justice  systems  are  working  on  it 
continuously.  In this paper, we mentioned fundamental  terms  
of  cybersecurity,  cyber  capabilities  of  some  countries,  some  
important cyber attacks  in  near  past,  and  finally,  globally  
applied  cyber  warfare  law  for  this attacks.

Since the technology is being developed incredibly fast, it 
certainly becomes part of our daily life and effects it either 
in  a  good  way  or  in  a  bad  way.  It  is  fair  to  say  that  the 
internet  became  a  central  factor  of  these  technological 
developments. The new phase of international relationships 
between  states  and  domestic  relationships  between  states 
this  modern 
with 
technology.  Instead  of  traditional  ways,  many  states  begun 
to  use  new  communication  methods  and  replaced  the  old 
ones.  They  now  provide  services  to  their  citizens  over  a 
network such as passport and visa applications, tax and bill 
payments,  exchange  and  open  market  operations,  banking 
and  insurance  transactions,  registration  procedures  for 
military  services  etc.  All  these  services  can  be  used  via 
computers,  tablets  and  even  smart  phones  with  an  internet 
connection.  Even  though,  there  are  many  benefits  of  this 
system,  every  action  has  an  equal  and  opposite  reaction. 
Cyber  terrorism,  cyber  threats,  cyber  espionage,  and  cyber 
war  are  the  other  side  of  the  coin.  While  personal  privacy 
was in danger against these perils, risks are much higher at 
national security level. Attackers are trying to steal, damage, 
information  from  people, 
destroy  or  control  critical 
governments.

Cybercrimes in a lower scale and cyber warfare in a higher 
scale  easily  can  turn  a  daydream  into  a  nightmare.  Albeit 
these  technological  systems  are  getting  more  sophisticated, 
attacks against these structures are getting more complicated 
as  well.  Battlefields  are  now  shifting  from  actual  places  to 
virtual areas. Besides their land forces, air forces and navy, 
countries  create  cyber  armies  nowadays.  There  are  some 
certain  applied  rules  and  laws  to  use  these  forces  and  they 
need to be adapted to cyber war as well. Although countries 
have  different  types  of  laws  for  cyberspace  domestically, 
there isn’t any binding law for cyber warfare globally. This 
study  focuses  the  laws,  regulations  and  manuals  which  are 
developed

perspective of the chapter. Toward the end, specifically state 
the objectives of the chapter.   

for  cyber  warfare.  Describe 

II.  CYBER TERMINOLOGY 

A.  Cyberspace 

The expression cyberspace initially showed up in a short 
story  named  “Burning  Chrome”  in  the  1982  written  by 
American author William Gibson and later in his 1984 novel 
“Neuromancer”.    In  the  following  couple    of    years,    the  
word  turned  out  to  be  conspicuously  related  to  online  
PC    systems.    The  term  cyberspace  which,  is  used  mostly   
to   express   the   internet   contains   numerical   interaction   
and communication method.  According  to  the  definition  
of  White  House “Cyberspace  is  composed  of hundreds of 
thousands  of  interconnected  computers,  servers,  routers, 
switches,  and  fiber  optic  cables  that  allow  our  critical  
infrastructures    to    work  [1].”U.S.  Department  of    Defense  
describes cyberspace  as “A  global   domain    within   the   
information  environment  consisting  of  the  interdependent   
network      of  information    technology    infrastructures    and  
resident  data,  including  the  Internet,  telecommunications 
networks,  computer  systems,  and  embedded  processors  
and    controllers    [2].”    NATO    says,    on    the    other  hand,  
people  are  part  of  cyberspace  as  well  and  defines  it  as 

 
 
 
 
“Cyberspace    is    more    than    the    internet,  including    not  
only    hardware,    software    and    information    systems,    but  
also  people  and  social  interaction within these networks 
[3].” 

B.  Cybersecurity 

Protecting  frameworks,  systems  and  information  in 
cyberspace against cyber threats needs some sort of security. 
All tools, methods, guidance, activities, and technologies to 
defend  assets  and  privacy  of  users,  organizations,  agencies 
and  governments  called  cybersecurity.  Main  purpose  of 
cybersecurity  is  preventing  possible  security  hazards  to 
assure safety and privacy of crucial data in the internet.   

C.  Cyber Warfare 

Before all those technologies, there were only ground and 
maritime  warfare.  In  1900s,  developments  on  aeronautic 
make aerial combat another battlefield. Space became a new 
warfare between super powers in 1950s. In the 21st century, 
cyber warfare joined to war terminology and described as a 
fifth  combat  zone.  Even  though  there  are  many  definitions 
for cyber warfare since there isn’t any peace treaty for it, it’s 
hard to describe which malicious activities are considered as 
cyber  warfare. The most critical uncertainty is the edge for 
seeing a digital episode as the use of power. The privilege to 
self-preservation  is  activated  by  the  use  of  power.  This 
makes the subject of the edge between a demonstration that 
legitimizes  the  use  of  power  accordingly  (a  demonstration 
of  war)  and  a  demonstration  that  does  not  key  to  the 
examination  of  cyber  warfare.  An  act  of  war  is  the  risk  or 
use  of  power  against  the  territorial  integrity  or  political 
freedom [4].  

By general definition “cyber warfare refers to a massively 
coordinated  digital  assault  on  a  government  by  another,  or 
by large groups of citizens. It is the action by a nation-state 
to  penetrate  another  nation’s  computers  and  networks  for 
the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” Be that as it 
may, it includes that “the  term cyber  warfare may also be 
used  to  describe  attacks    between    corporations,    from 
terrorist  organizations,  or  simply  attacks  by  individuals 
called hackers,  who are perceived as being  warlike in their 
intent [2] [5].” 

According  to  RAND  corporation  not  just  attacks  even, 
attempts  to  harm  another  country's  computers  or  data 
networks  through  are  also  considered  as  cyber  warfare  [6].  
Including Advanced Persistent Threats (APT).  

Richard Clarke defines cyberwar as “actions by a nation -
state to penetrate another nation's computer or networks for 
the purposes of causing damage or disruption [7].” Based on 
his definition, this action should be between states and there 
should be damage to be cyberwar.  

When  we  look  at  all  definitions  of  cyber  warfare,  even  
though  there  is  no  reciprocal  conflict  one  another  if  there  
are damage(s) and harmful results because of  cyber  attacks 
it  can  be  characterized  as  cyberwar.  Even  if  those  virtual 
attacks  didn’t  create  impacts  like  real  battles  did  so  far, 

when  we  think  about  worst  case  scenarios  there  are 
extremely  serious  risks.  Richard  Clarke  expresses  how 
cyber  warfare  can  be  devastating  like  a  real  war  for  many 
countries,  despite  the  fact  it  would  be  begun  between  two 
nations. He emphasizes that a cyberwar could begin and end 
so  quickly,  and  systems  which  are  used  for  traditional  war 
can be destroyed easily by cyber attacks [7]. If we compare 
cyberwar  with  traditional  wars,  there  are  some  main 
differences. One of them is the harm they create. It’s hard to 
predict  that  what  would  be  the  damage  after  cyber  attacks. 
Planning  and  executing  cyber  assaults  might  be  in  a  short 
pass  of  time.  When  the  system  is  affected,  whole  structure 
will  fall  rapidly.  After  the  attackers  infiltrate  systems  and 
gain  the  control,  anything  could  happen  depend  on  what 
kind of system was captured. Physical damages, injuries and 
even deaths could be the possible outcomes due to targeting 
physical systems which are controlled by computers. In case 
of  extremely  critical  infrastructures  are  invaded  by  these 
cyber attacks such as a nuclear reactor, massive harm can be 
created  and  that  would  be  catastrophic.  Another  difference 
is weapons. Weapons which are used for cyber battles such 
as  computer  systems,  hardware  and  software  are  much 
than  real  ammunitions.  
cheaper  and  more  available 
Determining  the  origin  of  the  cyber  attack  and  identifying 
the  attackers  aren’t  easy  and  might  be  the  most  important 
difference between cyberwar with a typical war. Hackers are 
incognito. They are nameless and they are faceless. Most of 
the time they don’t have any identification or they use fake 
ones. Malicious activities steered through numerous regions. 
As  long  as  the  attackers  accept  what  they  did,  it’s  almost 
impossible to provide hard proof for the felony. Finally, it is 
certainly  more  critical  information  can  be  gathered  and 
more enormous damage can be caused with reasonable costs 
via  cyber  attacks.  That’s  why  it  is  understandable  how 
cyberspace  is  getting  to  be  center  of  the  attention  for  the 
future.  In  the  next  chapter  to  get  a  better  idea,  cyber 
capabilities  of  some  major  countries  and  some  important 
cyber attacks in near past will be studied. 

III.  CYBER CAPABILITIES BY COUNTRY 

Many  nations  have  or  are  creating  apparatuses  for  PC 
undercover  work  and  assault  including  espionage  and 
sabotage.  While  activities 
in  cyberspace  are  military 
doctrine for some countries, for some others, they are part of 
their national security program. In his book, according to R. 
Clarke, a capability of countries on cyberspace varies based 
on  their  cyber  dependencies,  cyber  attacks,  and  cyber 
defense  [7].  United  States,  China,  Russia  and  North  Korea 
are the main actors on cyberspace.   

A.  United States 

In 2002, first step was taken for cyber warfare strategies 
by  the  President.  There  are  four  main  actors  besides  many 
other  agencies  which  are  USCYBERCOM  “to  plan, 
coordinate, integrate, synchronize and conduct activities to: 
direct the operations and defense of specified Department of 

Defense  information  networks  and;  prepare  to,  and  when 
directed,  conduct 
full  spectrum  military  cyberspace 
operations in order  to enable actions in all domains, ensure 
US/Allied  freedom  of  action  in  cyberspace  and  deny  the 
same  to  our  adversaries  [8],”  NSA/CSS  (The  National 
Security Agency/Central Security Service) “to lead the U.S. 
Government  in  cryptology  that  encompasses  both  Signals 
Intelligence  (SIGINT)  and  Information  Assurance  (IA) 
products  and  services,  and  enables  Computer  Network 
Operations (CNO) in order to gain a decision advantage for 
the Nation and our allies under all circumstances [9]”,  US-
CERT  (The  Department  of  Homeland  Security's  United 
States  Computer  Emergency  Readiness  Team)  “to  lead 
efforts  to  improve  the  Nation's  cybersecurity  posture, 
coordinate  cyber 
information  sharing,  and  proactively 
manage  cyber  risks  to  the  Nation...[10]”,  and  the  FBI 
(Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation)  “to  prevent  harm  to 
national  security  as  the  nation’s  domestic  intelligence 
agency and to enforce federal laws as the nation’ s principal 
law enforcement agency [11].” 

B.  China 

Technical 

Emergency  Response 

According to the annual report of the National Computer 
Network 
Team 
Coordination Center of China (CNCERT or CNCERT/CC), 
China  has  noticeable  IT  infrastructure  and  advanced  cyber 
weapons.  China  plays  an  active  role  on  cyberspace  and 
cyber attacks. Digital attacks against China and from China 
significantly  increased  in  recent  years  [12].  A  spokesman 
from  China’s  Ministry  of  Defence  and  the  People’s 
Liberation Army (PLA) says cyberwar and cyber attacks are 
serious  and  important  as  much  as  other  wars  [13].  The 
announcement  was  made  by  National  Defense  of  the 
People’s  Republic  of  China  about  establishment  of 
Information  Protection  Base  under 
the  General  Staff 
Department  on  20  July  2010  [14].  In  mid-2014,  first 
professional  "blue  army"  troop  unit  was  built  up  by  the 
PLA.  The  Blue  Army  offends  data  and  a  network  when 
contrasted with conventional military [15].   

C.  Russia 

When  the  internet  is  concerned,  Russia  is  the  most 
agonized  over  the  risk  postured  by  antagonistic.  “The 
Federal Security Service (FSB) is a federal executive body 
with  the  authority  to  implement  government  policy  in  the 
national  security  of  the  Russian  Federation  ...  ensuring  the 
information  security  of  Russia  and  exercising  the  basic 
functions  of  the  federal  security  services  specified  in  the 
Russian legislation ... [16]  [17].” Own-created and off-the-
track  hacking  devices  utilized  by  FSB  intelligence  agency, 
which operates locally and globally. On the other hand, the 
Special  Communications  and  Information  Service  of  the 
Federal  Protective  Service  of  the  Russian  Federation 
and  Federal  Agency  of  Government 
(Spetssvyaz) 
Communications  and  Information  (FAGCI/FAPSI)  are  in 
charge  of  the  gathering  and  investigation  of  international 

communications  and  signal  intelligence,  and  in  addition, 
ensuring  Russian  government  correspondences  and  data 
systems,  which  includes  data  security  and  cryptanalysis 
[18]. There are critical differentiations between western and 
Russian ideas of digital security. Russia has a statist idea of 
who ought to be included in the internet; Russian authorities 
affirm  the  guideline  of  national  limits.  Furthermore,  the 
Russian  idea  of  breach  of  data  space  is  not  popular  in  the 
West.  Russia  wants 
international 
arrangements about cyberspace with support of its allies like 
China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan [19]. 

create  new 

to 

D.  North Korea 

North Korea has more than 5,000 hacker forces based on 
South  Korean’s  reports  [20].  A  new  unit  was  initially 
established  by  North  Korean  military 
that 
concentrates exclusively on digital warfare. The unit, named 
Unit 121 has consistently developed in size and ability from 
that  point  forward  [21].  They  have  threatened  everything 
from  further  ballistic  rocket  tests,  another  atomic  test, 
withdrawal from the 1953 cease-fire that ended Korean War 
dangers (there is  no peace settlement) and cyber  warfare is 
no exception [22]. 

in  1998 

IV.  MOST THREATINING CYBER WARFARE ATTACKS IN 
NEAR PAST 

Cyber  attacks  became  much  more  sophisticated  and 
complex  since  Robert  Morris  created  the  first  computer 
worm  to  test  the  size  of  the  internet  in  1989  [23].  It  is 
possible  to  say  that  cyberwar  is  already  happening  on 
cyberspace nowadays. Discovery  of Stuxnet (the first cyber 
warfare weapon ever known) was a defining moment ever in 
the  history  of  cybersecurity.  As  opposed 
to  starting 
conviction,  Stuxnet  wasn't  about  mechanical  undercover 
work. It didn't take, control, or delete data. Instead, Stuxnet's 
objective  was  to  physically  annihilate  a  military  target 
allegorically,  as  well  as  truly  [24].  Stuxnet  has  obviously 
contaminated  more  than  60,000  PCs  around  the  world, 
mostly in Iran [25]. A definitive objective of Stuxnet was to 
harm  that  facility  by  reprogramming  programmable  logic 
controllers  (PLCs) to work as the attackers intend them to, 
no doubt out of their predefined limits [26]. In spite of  the 
fact  that  the  creators  of  Stuxnet  haven't  been  formally 
recognized,  the  size  and  complexity  of  the  worm  have 
persuaded  that  it  could  have  been  made  with  support  of 
state(s). Even though there isn’t any conclusive evidence, it 
is believed that the United States and Israel behind  Stuxnet 
[27].  

Another  country  who  suffered  from  cyber  attacks  was 
Estonia.  Estonia’s  network  infrastructure  was  targeted  by 
hackers on  April 27, 2007 and running  for a time of a  few 
weeks.  No  less  than  128  exceptional  DDOS  assaults 
focusing  on  internet  conventions  in  Estonia  occurred  amid 
this period. Internet traffic expanded from 20,000 packets to 
more than 4 million packets for every second [28]. Estonian 
authorities  like  Foreign  Minister  Urmas  Paet  immediately 

blamed Russia for executing the assaults, however European 
Commission  and  NATO  specialized  specialists  were  not 
able  find  enough  evidence  for  confirmation  of  Kremlin 
participation  in  these  cyber  attacks.  Following  quite  a  long 
while of lobbying, Estonia as of late got NATO emergency 
courses  of  action  to  secure  the  nation  in  the  case  of  a 
theoretical Russian intrusion [29].  

Tanks, artillery and warplanes weren’t the only weapons 
Russia used against the Georgia when the Russian-Georgian 
War  begun  in  August  of  2008.  Before  any  gun  was  fired, 
cyber  attacks  were  already  hitting  Georgia.  54  websites  in 
Georgia  related 
the 
government  was  targeted  immediately.  All  communication 
channels were hacked for preventing Georgian public to be 
informed [30].  

to  communications,  finance,  and 

China  has  developed  a  communications  intelligence 
program  called  Golden  Shield  using  new  and  advanced 
technologies  to  gather  domestic  and  foreign  intelligence. 
There are too many state-level cyber attacks from China to 
United States so those attacks are even named. Titan Rain is 
a U.S. code name for Chinese military cyber assaults against 
the U.S. [31]. One of these attacks called Operation Aurora. 
Operation  Aurora  was  a  progression  of  digital  assaults 
directed by advanced persistent threats (APTs) with binds to 
the PLA. The assault was to a great degree wide-scale and is 
believed  to  have  focused  on  34  organizations  along  with 
Yahoo,  Symantec,  Northrop  Grumman,  Morgan  Stanley, 
Dow  Chemical  and  Google.  Sophistication  of  Operation 
Aurora makes the security vendor McAfee to believe it was 
produced by defense industry [32] [33].  

computer 

In  October  2012,  Kaspersky  Lab's  group  of  specialists 
started an examination taking after a progression of assaults 
against 
international 
diplomatic  service  agencies.  A  substantial  scale  cyber 
espionage activities system was uncovered and broke down 
amid  the  examination.  It  was  named  Operation  Red 
October, called Rocra for short [34].  

networks 

targeting 

According  to  security  experts,  a  complex  targeted  on 
digital  assault  that  gathered  private  information  from 
nations,  for  example,  Israel  and  Iran  has  been  revealed 
which  known  as  Flame,  had  been  operating  since  August 
2010. Regardless of whether Flame did any genuine harm to 
Iran's  oil  and  gas  production,  energy  sector  in  Iran  had 
suffered because of these cyber attacks [35].  

A  self-replicating  virus  (Shamoon)  infected  more  than 
30,000 devices of Saudi Aramco on 15 August 2012 which 
caused huge interruption to the world's biggest oil producer 
[36].  

Another  example  of  global  cyberwar  is  Turla  malware. 
This 
time  former  Eastern  Bloc  countries’  diplomatic 
embassies  were  targeted.  The  main  motivation  behind  the 
attacks was to monitor these embassies closely [37].  

Kaspersky  and  Symantec  both  reported  interestingly  the 
revelation of a digital weapon framework which they called 
Regin. By, the malware had as of now been available for use 
for  a  long  time  and  targeting  many  nations  such  as 

Germany,  Belgium,  Brazil,  India  and  Indonesia.  Some 
accuses  the  Five  Eyes  Alliance,  which  includes  the  US, 
Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as a creator of 
the malware [38].  

IRATEMONK  gives  programming  application  ingenuity 
on  PCs  embedding  the  hard  drive  firmware  to  gain 
execution  through  Master  Boot  Record  (MBR)  substitution 
which was allegedly created by the Equation Group who are 
assumed  to  be  the  most  sophisticated  and  advanced  cyber 
attack group in the world. Tens of thousands of victims were 
affected  by  the  Equation  Group’s  CNE  (computer  network 
exploitation)  operations,  including  sectors  like  government 
and  diplomatic  institutions,  telecoms,  aerospace,  energy, 
nuclear  research,  oil  and  gas,  military,  nanotechnology, 
Islamic  activists  and  scholars,  mass  media,  transportation, 
financial institutions, and Companies developing encryption 
technologies.  They  use  exceptional  and  complex  tools 
which they called their trojans, such as EQUATIONLASER, 
EQUATIONDRUG,  DOUBLEFANTASY,TRIPLEFANTASY, 
FANNY, GRAYFISH and many others [39] [40] [41].  

V.  CYBER WAREFARE LAW 

It is important to  know  what  kind of legal actions  states 
can  take  globally  when  they  are  exposed  to  such  cyber 
attacks.  As  said  before,  cyberspace  is  a  new  warfare  and 
there  are  still  so  many  legal  loopholes  in  international 
regulations  about  cyber  attacks.  Former  NSA  Director  Lt. 
Gen. Keith B. Alexander emphasized to the members of the 
Senate  Armed  Services  Committee  in  2010  that  cyber 
warfare  was  advancing  so  quickly  and  there  was  a 
“mismatch  between  our  technical  capabilities  to  conduct 
operations  and  the  governing  laws  and  policies.”  Professor 
of Law and the Director of the Center for Terrorism Law at 
St. Mary’s University School of Law Jeffrey F. Addicott has 
similar  perspective.  In  his  opinion  “international  laws 
associated  with the use of  force are  woefully inadequate in 
terms of addressing the threat of cyber warfare [42] [43].”   

According  to  many  countries  cyberwar  is  not  any 
different than conventional war from angle of legal aspects. 
Cyberwar  is  within  the  scope  of  international  legal  system 
for war. Based on Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, an 
attack  on  one  Ally  shall  be  considered  an  attack  on  all 
Allies.  Recently,  this  article  was  extended  by  NATO 
members including cyber attacks [44]. Additionally, NATO 
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence which is a 
NATO-accredited research and training facility dealing with 
education,  consultation, 
learned,  research  and 
lessons 
development in the field of cybersecurity was founded on 14 
May, 2008 in Tallinn, Estonia [45].  

There  are  two  recognizable  methods  for  taking  a  gander 
at war under international law. “Both of the two traditional 
branches  of  the  law  of  war:  (i)  the  Jus  ad  bellum,  which 
governs  resort  to  war,  and  (ii)  the  Jus  in  bello,  which 
governs  the  conduct  of  hostilities  [46].”  These  methods 
were  applied  for  cyberwar  as  well.  Previous  experiences 
showed  that  preventing  violent  actions  before  happening  is 

more critical and beneficial than trying to fix it after, which 
is valid for cyber conflicts too. To achieve this purpose the 
Law of Armed Conflict was created (LOAC). Generally the 
applicability  of  the  LOAC  regularly  relied  on  a  State 
subjectively  characterizing  a  contention  as  a  war. 
Recognition  of  a  condition  of  war  is  no  more  required  to 
trigger the LOAC. After the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 
LOAC  is  currently  activated  by  the  presence  of  armed 
conflict  between  States.  Even  though  the  law  is  for  armed 
conflicts, it can be a reference point for cyber warfare [47] 
[48].  2(4)  of  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  and  Statute  of 
International Court of Justice which was signed on 26 June 
1945, in San Francisco clearly expresses that “All Members 
shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or 
use  of  force  against  the  territorial  integrity  or  political 
independence  of  any  state,  or  in  any  other  manner 
inconsistent with the Purposes of the United  Nations [49].” 
Using  armed  attacks  are  only  acceptable  under 
the 
conditions  of  self-defense  and  agreement  of  UN  Security 
Council. Article 51 explains that as “Nothing in the present 
Charter  shall  impair  the  inherent  right  of  individual  or 
collective  self-defense  if  an  armed  attack  occurs  against  a 
Member  of  the  United  Nations,  until  the  Security  Council 
has  taken  the  measures  necessary  to  maintain  international 
peace  and  security.  Measures  taken  by  Members  in  the 
exercise  of  this  right  of  self-defense  shall  be  immediately 
reported  to  the  Security  Council  and  shall  not  in  any  way 
affect  the  authority  and  responsibility  of  the  Security 
Council  under  the  present  Charter  to  take  at  any  time  such 
action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore 
international  peace  and  security  [49].”  The  right  of  self-
defense is given to all members if there is a threat or use of 
force 
integrity  or  political 
independence in case of armed attacks. Cyber attacks, on the 
other  hand,  aren’t  armed  attacks  for  the  UN  therefore  it 
can’t  be  countered  using  armed  assaults.  A  more  common 
starting  point  for  analysis  is  to  consider  the  impacts  or 
outcomes  of  a  digital  assault  figuring  out  if  it  crosses  the 
edge  of  armed  attack.  It  was  suggested  that  to  qualify  a 
cyber  attack  as  an  armed  attack  there  must  be  violent 
consequences like bombs produce [50]. 

territorial 

against 

the 

Geneva  Conventions  Article  49,  however,  defines  attack 
as  “...  acts  of  violence  against  the  adversary,  whether  in 
offence  or  in  defence  [51].”  Instead  of  focusing  armed 
attacks,  Article 49 describes the attack based on its results. 
So if cyber attacks  cause any violent outcomes, some legal 
experts  say  it  should  be  considered  within  the  scope  of 
Charter  of  the  United  Nations  Article  51.  Aforementioned 
article  does  not  apply  to  individuals  or  groups.  It  only 
applies  to  states.  That  means  a  person  or  a  group  can’t  be 
the  subject  of  Article  51’s  self-defense.  In  this  case,  it  is 
almost  impossible  to  hold  any  state  responsible  for  cyber 
attacks  as  long  as  it  is  admitted  officially  by  them.  For 
instance,  although  within  the  knowledge  of  everyone  that 
Russian  government  sponsored  digital  attacks  against 
Estonia  in  2007,  no  one  put  the  blame  on  Russian

of  States 
Internationally Wrongful Acts states that “... the basic rules 
of  international  law  concerning  the  responsibility  of  States 
for  their  internationally  wrongful  acts.  The  emphasis  is  on 
the secondary rules of State responsibility: that is to say, the 
general conditions under international law for the State to be 
considered  responsible  for  wrongful  actions  or  omissions, 
and  the  legal  consequences  which  flow  therefrom.  The 
articles  do  not  attempt  to  define  the  content  of  the 
international  obligations,  the  breach  of  which  gives  rise  to 
responsibility.  This  is  the  function  of  the  primary  rules, 
whose  codification  would 
involve  restating  most  of 
substantive  customary  and  conventional  international  law 
[52]. International Humanitarian Law (IHL), also known as 
the  laws  of  war  is  the  structure  for  situations  of  armed 
conflict and occupation. The main purpose behind the law is 
limiting  the  effects  of  armed  conflict  mostly  for  civilians 
who  are  not  directly  part  of  the  war  [53].  Even  supposing 
state  level  cyber  weapons  are  intended  to  be  used  for 
military actions notwithstanding civilians can be harmed as 
well because of the consequences of these cyber attacks. It 
is  also  not  clear  whether  IHL  is  applicable  or  not  in  this 
situations.  For  this  purpose,  International  Cyber  Incidents: 
Legal  Considerations  was  published  by  Cooperative  Cyber 
Defence  Centre  of  Excellence  (CCD    COE)  in  2010  to 
enlighten  some  issues  about  legal  cyber  challenges  that 
urges  legal  authorities  “To  establish  a  robust  and  efficient 
cyber  defence  regime,  legal  and  policy  frameworks  must 
have  a  multidisciplinary  approach  that  incorporates  legal 
jurisdictions  for  prevention  and  response  to  all-hazard 
threats;  international  collaboration  and  cooperation;  an 
understanding  of  private 
and 
responsibilities  (under  public  ordering  such  as  regulations, 
as  well  as  private  ordering  such  as  contracts)  for  the  ICT 
systems and assets that are the new components of national 
and international security; and regard for the community of 
users [54].”

“In 2009, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre 
of Excellence (NATO CCD COE), an international military 
organization  based  in  Tallinn,  Estonia,  and  accredited  in 
2008  by  NATO  as  a  ‘Centre  of  Excellence’,  invited  an 
independent  ‘International  Group  of  Experts’  to  produce  a 
manual  on  the  law  governing  cyber  warfare  ...  ‘Tallinn

to produce a non-binding document applying existing law to

The  second  edition  of  Tallinn  Manual  (Tallinn  2.0)  was

published in 2016 [55].              

The  jus  ad  bellum  (the  law  governing  the  use  of  force) 
and  jus  in  bello  (international  humanitarian  law)  are  the 
essential core interests of Tallinn Manual.  

Tallinn  Manual  consists  of  two  parts  and  95  rules. 
International cybersecurity law and the law of cyber armed 
conflict are the titles of the parts. The first part has subtitles 
like  state  and  cyberspace,  the  use  of  force,  while  second 
part’s  subtitles  are  the  law  of  armed  conflict  generally, 
conduct of hostilities, certain persons, objects and activities, 
occupation and neutrality.  

There  are  five  rules  under  Section  1:  Sovereignty, 
jurisdiction, and control. First 5 rules tries to draw a line for 
cyberspace  based  on  cyber  infrastructure  within  states’ 
idea  of  sovereignty  and 
the 
territories  and  explains 
jurisdiction.   

(Rule  1)  A  State  may  exercise  control  over  cyber 

infrastructure and activities within its sovereign territory.  

Rules  6,  7,  8  and  9  slightly  mention  the  law  of  State 

responsibility and precautions.   

(Rule  6)  A  State  bears  international  legal  responsibility 
for a cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes 
a breach of an international obligation.               

(Rule  9)  A  State  injured  by  an  internationally  wrongful 
act  resort  to  proportionate  countermeasures,  including 
cyber countermeasures, against the responsible State.  

It  is  hard  to  identify  cyber  armed  attack  so  does  self-
defence against it. Armed attack was consistently seen as a 
higher limit than use of force. According to the manual “... 
the most disruptive and destructive cyber operations – those 
that qualify as ‘armed attacks’ and therefore allow States to 
respond in self-defence.” 

(Rule  13)  A  State  that  is  the  target  of  a  cyber  operation 
that  rises  to  level  of  an  armed  attack  may  exercise  its 
inherent  right  of  self-defence.  Whether  a  cyber  operation 
constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects. 
One  another  significant  issues  that  were  addressed  in 
Tallinn  Manual  are  defining  cyber  attacks  and  protecting 
civilians. “In the Tallinn Manual, attacks include operations 
that  cause  injury  or  death  to  people  or  damage  or  destroy 
objects (Rule  30);  any  attack  directed  against  civilians  
or  civilian  objects with these  consequences  is   unlawful 
(Rules    31-32).  Some  experts  stretched  the  cyber  attack 
notion  to  include  a  cyber  operation  that  engenders  loss  of 
functionality and thereby requires repair of the system [56].”  

(Rule  32)  The  civilian  population  as  such,  as  well  as 

individual civilians, shall not be the object of cyber attack. 

 CONCLUSION  

On  April  1,  2015  President  Barack  Obama  signed  an 
executive  order  authorizing  the  Treasury  Department  to 
financially sanction anyone using cyber attacks “that create 
a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy or 
economic  health  or  financial  stability  of  the  United  States 
[57].” Taking legal countermeasures against cyber attacks is 
being  more  important  and  serious.  Despite  the  fact  that 
apparently  there  is  confusion  about  international  legal 
actions for cyber warfare. Either in state-level or individual, 
hackers  should be put on trial due process of law.  Admiral 
Michael  Rogers  who  is  the  current  Commander  of  U.S. 
Cyber  Command  and  Director  of  the  National  Security 
Agency says “Remember, anything we do in the cyber arena 
...  must  follow  the  law  of  conflict.  Our  response  must  be 
proportional, must be in line  with the broader set of norms 
that we’ve created over time. I don’t expect cyber to be any 
different  [58].”  Vulnerability  of  internet  will  continue  for 
quite  a  while  accordingly,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  avoid 
all those cyber attacks, espionage and sabotage. That’s why 
it  is  so  critical  to  know  for  the  states  which  were  exposed 
cyber  attacks  their  legal  rights  and  how  to  respond  them 
legally  to  prevent  chaos  or  maybe  even  something  more. 
Even  though,  there  are  some  guidance  about  how  law 
should applied in case of cyber attacks/war, it is simply not 
enough  and  not  obligated  by  the  international  authorities. 
Cyber  warfare  law  is  the  new  area  of  research  for 
international laws and especially for international war law.
