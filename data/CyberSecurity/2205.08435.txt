Abstract

Cyber risk is an omnipresent risk in the increasingly digitized world that is known to be
diﬃcult to quantify and assess. Despite the fact that cyber risk shows distinct characteristics
from conventional risks, most existing models for cyber risk in the insurance literature have
been purely based on frequency-severity analysis, which was developed for classical property and
casualty risks. In contrast, the cybersecurity engineering literature employs diﬀerent approaches,
under which cyber incidents are viewed as threats or hacker attacks acting on a particular set of
vulnerabilities. There appears a gap in cyber risk modeling between engineering and insurance
literature. This paper presents a novel model to capture this unique dynamics of cyber risk
known from engineering and to model loss distributions based on industry loss data and a
particular company’s cybersecurity proﬁle. The analysis leads to a new tool for allocating
resources of the company between cybersecurity investments and loss-absorbing reserves.

Keywords: cyber risk assessment, information systems, cybersecurity investments, capital allo-
cation, IT policy and management.

Introduction

As modern businesses and public-sector entities have become greatly reliant on information tech-

nology (IT) to boost the eﬃciency of workﬂows and stay connected with the world, potential cyber

incidents, such as data breaches, are imposing great dangers on organizations’ daily operations.

To eﬀectively manage cyber risk, cyber risk assessment is a complex but essential task for IT de-

partments before any measures are eﬀectively implemented. However, as an emerging type of risk,

cyber risk is more diﬃcult to assess than many other traditional risks for reasons including the

following.

• Lack of quantitative tools for comprehensive cyber risk assessment. Although there are lots
of eﬀorts in quantifying some aspects of cyber risk, such as the impact of data breaches

(see, for example, Xu et al. (2018) and Eling and Wirfs (2019)), it should be recognized

that cyber systems consist of numerous types of physical and virtual components, and they

may have drastically diﬀerent risk exposures. In order to guide business decisions on cyber

risk management, a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the risk that integrates all

those components is crucial, but the tool for such a purpose is lacking in the literature.

• Adaptive nature of cyber risk. As summarized in DiMase et al. (2015), cyber risk is dynamic
in the sense that in cyberspace, adversaries are consistently developing new strategies and

attacks to overcome or bypass existing defense mechanisms.

In other words, even a well-

protected system by today’s cybersecurity technology may still be vulnerable again in a future

time. Therefore, an ideal framework for cyber risk assessment has to take both internal factors,

such as security measures, and external factors, such as trending attacking techniques, into

account. The latter component is usually missing in many existing risk assessment approaches.

• Correlated losses. It is well-known that because of the connectedness of the cyberspace, cyber
risks are correlated. B¨ohme and Kataria (2006) discussed two modes of correlation, namely

intra-ﬁrm risk correlation and global risk correlation. From the perspective of a decision

maker, who manages the cyber risk of a particular company, the intra-ﬁrm correlation is

more of a concern. That is, a single cyber incident may result in multiple points of failure,

each of which can lead to a loss; see, for example, Alderson et al. (2014). Such a dependence

among losses can be obscure and easily overlooked by risk managers.

It is of interest to both cybersecurity and risk management communities to develop innovative

risk assessment methods to address the above-mentioned diﬃculties. Focusing on diﬀerent aspects

of cyber risks, those two communities have developed vastly diﬀerent approaches to cyber risk

assessment and management.

Cybersecurity approach

In the cybersecurity literature, researchers oftentimes focus on the structural properties of cyber

systems and study the risks at a microscopic level. For example, Wang and Lu (2013) discussed

security issues associated with smart grids with extensive insights into the vulnerabilities in indi-

vidual components of the network, such as diﬀerent types of denial-of-service attacks that might

be performed on various components of the communication layer, and then proposed countermea-

sures to potential threats, including various attack detection mechanisms and attack mitigation

approaches targeting network and physical layers. Those insights are helpful for smart grid oper-

ators to identify risks and build a list of action items for risk mitigation. A similar approach is

taken in Frustaci et al. (2018) for the identiﬁcation and reduction of risks in Internet-of-Things

(IoT) systems. The authors identiﬁed that the perception layer, which is composed of physical IoT

2

sensors, is the most vulnerable part of an IoT system, and proposed a score-based risk assessment

method for critical security issues in accordance with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System

proposed by the National Infrastructure Advisory Council. For cyber risks in autonomous vehicles,

Parkinson et al. (2017) examined possible vulnerabilities from three aspects, including vehicle, hu-

man, and connection infrastructure, and hypothesized the impacts that might result from the lack

of certain knowledge about those vulnerabilities and their mitigations.

Based on the same methodology but for more generalized use cases in industrial environments,

regulators and leaders of the cybersecurity industry have developed a handful of guidelines and

frameworks. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has devel-

oped a generic set of controls called the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) (see NIST (2018)), which

can be used as a voluntary guidance for organizations to manage their cyber risk. Largely derived

from that framework, the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards is developed and en-

forced by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in the utility industry (see

NERC (2008)). Similarly, as a cybersecurity industry leader, the Center for Internet Security (CIS)

has compiled a detailed list of commonly known vulnerable components in cyber systems and best

practices in risk mitigation into CIS Controls (see CIS (2021)).

In terms of their practicality, one potential shortcoming of these is the lack of insight into the

prioritization of tasks from the cost-beneﬁt perspective. For example, Security and Privacy Con-

trols for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (known as SP 800-53) is a core component

in NIST CSF (see NIST (2018)), and although it assigns priority codes to security controls, as clar-

iﬁed in the document, those codes are for implementation sequencing that is reasoned from the

engineering point of view, but they provide no information on whether or not it is economically

beneﬁcial to implement a certain control. Except those who are subject to the requirements in SP

800-53 (including government agencies, contractors, and subcontractors), other organizations may

ﬁnd such guidelines not instructive enough on how to allocate capital and spend money on imple-

menting these security controls. As mentioned in Gordon et al. (2015), private-sector ﬁrms have

other investment decisions than cybersecurity and they all compete for limited organizational re-

sources. For this reason, cost-beneﬁt analysis is important in the decision-making process regarding

cybersecurity investment.

To associate cyber assets with economic losses, Tatar et al. (2020) proposed that once the

topology of a system is determined, the impact of potential cyber attacks can be evaluated using

an attack graph and an impact graph, the former of which describes the possible attack path

along interconnected nodes, and the latter of which quantitatively estimates the potential impacts

on nodes of a system. This method requires a microscopic assessment on individual software and

hardware vulnerabilities with respect to their probability of being exploited, which might be diﬃcult

to realize using any empirical methods given the data scarcity issue.

Overall, engineering approaches mainly focus on infrastructural details, but may not provide

enough support for strategical investment and capital allocation planning. Although there are

attempts to establish the link between the infrastructure of cyber systems and the losses arising

3

from them, the capital component in cyber risk management is largely missing in mainstream

solutions provided by the engineering community.

Economics literature

In the economics and ﬁnance literature, more emphasis is on the losses caused by cyber incidents,

while cyber systems are often highly abstracted. For example, Liu et al. (2020) modeled a power

system as a collection of nodes and modeled the dynamics of an attack on that system using an

absorbing semi-Markov process, which further lead to discussions on the ﬁnancial consequences

of cyber threats. Eling and Wirfs (2019) studied a dataset that contains historical cyber losses,

identiﬁed classes of cyber risks depending on causes, such as human error or technical failure,

and then modeled loss frequency and severity by probability distributions. Eling and Jung (2018)

studied a collection of historical data breaches and used vine copulas to model the dependence

among cyber losses in terms of the number of breached records. Using the same dataset of data

breaches, Xu et al. (2018) performed trend analyses and built stochastic models for the frequency

and size of data breaches caused by hacking.

Many of the studies from the economics and ﬁnance perspective help understand the conse-

quences of cyber incidents, thus providing organizations with hints on how to prepare for potential

losses resulting from various types of cyber incidents. There are also several economics studies that

try to draw connections between cyber losses and cybersecurity practices, such as how losses can be

reduced by implementing certain security controls. For example, Gordon and Loeb (2002) proposed

a model for calculating the optimal level of investment. The model expresses the probability of

experiencing a security breach as a function of security investment and then uses this probability

to calculate the expected loss. The optimal investment in cybersecurity is thus obtained when the

marginal investment is equal to the marginal reduction in expected loss. Smeraldi and Malacaria

(2014) formulated investment in cybersecurity as an optimization problem, known as the knapsack

problem, where there is a target to protect, a ﬁxed budget, and a set of cyber resources that each

can be invested in and generates a return, i.e., some level of protection for the target. The goal is to

maximize the overall return with the limited budget. The authors also proposed some variants to

this problem, where there could be interactions between resources, e.g., one could be an alternative

of the combination of another two resources in terms of the generated return, and where there

could be multiple targets to protect. These studies provide some insights into the question on how

much should be spent on cybersecurity based on the principle that there should be an equilibrium

in the trade-oﬀ between cyber investment and the residual cyber risk. That is, a decision maker

can choose to either spend more on cybersecurity investment and less on the capital reserved for

cyber losses, or the other way around.

To generalize this problem a little more, we can see it as the trade-oﬀ between the immediate

cost and the potential cost in the future. This type of problem is commonplace in the economics

literature on other topics than cyber.

For example, the well-known Laﬀer curve suggests that if a government sets a high tax rate,

4

the initial revenue from taxation may be large, but because of the low proﬁtability, companies may

reduce economic activities and the economy may contract, thus leading to low tax revenue. On the

contrary, if there is a low tax rate, companies increase production and the economy expands due

to a higher proﬁtability, thus leading to an expanded source of revenue in the future (see Wanniski

(1978)). Clearly, the government needs to strike a balance between the immediate tax income and

the income in the long run. Other than taxation, the Laﬀer curve eﬀect has been studied and

applied in many diﬀerent ﬁelds as well; see, for example, Tragler et al. (2001) and Janvry and

Sadoulet (2006). The analog of Laﬀer curve is introduced in this paper in the context of cyber risk

assessment to explain the trade-oﬀ between cybersecurity investment and loss reserve.

From a risk perspective, the future beneﬁt could be the reduction in the probability of the

occurrence of a loss event. Menegatti (2009) considers a two-period scenario, in which an investment

in eﬀort is made today to reduce the probability of a loss tomorrow, and studies how agents with

diﬀerent prudence levels choose their optimal invested eﬀorts. Hofmann and Peter (2015) oﬀers an

extension to that study, and shows how the curvature of utility and the presence of endogenous

saving aﬀect an agent’s choice of investing in either reducing the loss probability or reducing the

potential loss size.

Ideally, the thought process for investments in cyber should also include the consideration for

beneﬁts. However, as found in Alahmari and Duncan (2020), organizations rarely incorporate

this type of cost-beneﬁt analysis in cyber risk management. What might hinder the development

of such strategies is that the existing studies, such as Gordon and Loeb (2002) and Smeraldi

and Malacaria (2014), provide no identiﬁcation of speciﬁc cyber assets and vulnerabilities. When

multiple vulnerabilities and sources of losses are in concern, the lack of structural information on

cyber systems can make it diﬃcult for organizations to create actionable plans and put speciﬁc

controls in place.

Capital management framework for cyber risk and contributions

By observing the approaches taken by these two communities and comparing their diﬀerences, we

ﬁnd that solutions to speciﬁc cybersecurity challenges are usually the focus of engineering research,

whereas the economics and ﬁnance community typically emphasizes the outcomes of cyber incidents.

We believe these two aspects are both important because the former oﬀers instructions on how to

address speciﬁc cyber threats by implementing certain security controls, and the latter generates

economic incentives for organizations to take actions to reduce the risk. However, we are not aware

of any uniﬁed solution that takes beneﬁt of both perspectives.

Imagine that an organization is

considering investing in a set of CIS Controls. To make this management decision, it needs to

assess how much reduction in losses can be achieved by implementing those controls and determine

how much should be invested in each of them. These questions are non-trivial and yet to be

answered. It’s worth noting that the eﬀects of some cyber threats, such as potential reputation

damage to a company, can be diﬃcult to assess. The cost-beneﬁt analysis described in this study

may not be appropriate in such instances. As a result, we will concentrate our eﬀorts in this

5

study on issues with market value, such as the cost of hardware replacements and the cost of data

restoration.

To guide business decisions on cyber risk management, we propose a framework that quantiﬁes

this relationship and can be easily incorporated in the risk management decision making process.

This framework consists of two components as follows.

(i) Ex-ante investment, which is the investment in implementing security controls, such as hiring

cybersecurity professionals, applying security patches, and training personnel, and it has

an immediate eﬀect on reducing cyber risk exposure before any incidents happen.

In this

paper, we assume that the company has already implemented some controls which match

the industry-average security standard, and our discussions on cybersecurity investments

surround any additional spending on top of that level.

(ii) Ex-post-loss reserve, which is the emergency fund set up to cover losses resulting from cyber

incidents, such as forensics costs, costs for repairing or replacing cyber assets, and legal

liabilities in case of lawsuits. Note that, this fund is indeed reserved before any cyber incidents

happen, but it is then used to absorb losses after the incidents, which explains its ex-post-loss

eﬀect.

Our approach takes both components into consideration and ﬁnds an optimal strategy for businesses

to allocate their budgets on implementing various cyber controls and preparing for potential future

losses. The goal is to allocate a minimal amount of budget, including both the ex-ante investments

and the ex-post-loss coverage fund, for cyber risks, and at the same time, to minimize the impact

of cyber incidents.

The main contribution of this paper is ﬁve-fold.

• This paper presents the ﬁrst quantitative description of the cascade model previously known
in the engineering literature, to the best knowledge of authors. It bridges the gap between the

engineering approach and the economics and ﬁnance approach to cyber risk assessment by

providing a unifying framework. The new approach utilizes both the structural information

of cyber systems and historical cyber loss data to provide risk assessment and management

insights that are quantitative and speciﬁc to individual components in cyber systems.

• The framework is compatible and can be implemented along with the existing standards for
cybersecurity, such as the NIST CSF. This feature is important for the practicality of a cyber

risk management method, but is generally missing in the quantitative methods that have been

proposed. Therefore, our work oﬀers a pragmatic tool for decision making in the process of

complying with industry regulations and standards of practice.

• The framework addresses the three aforementioned challenges in cyber risk assessment. Not
limited to any speciﬁc type of risk, it incorporates the quantitative assessment of potential

losses that may arise from various points of failure in a cyber system.

In addition, the

6

framework considers both external threats and internal vulnerabilities and assets, so that

when a new threat emerges due to the adaptive nature of cyber risk, the model can be easily

updated to reﬂect such a change in environment. Various cyber components are linked in this

framework via attack paths, and that captures the dependence among the risk exposures of

them.

• The framework also oﬀers a tool of capital management that enables users to quantify and
assess the trade-oﬀ between cybersecurity investment and loss reserve. The capital manage-

ment model shows an extension of the Laﬀer curve in economics, which is a classic tool used

in economics to understand the balance between tax rates and tax revenue.

• The paper presents a novel application of collective risk modeling and Pareto optimization,
which are rarely discussed in the context of cyber risk. It presents that for the cyber risk

management in a business environment, there are competing priorities and objectives, and

those techniques are well-suited for such a problem.

The proposed risk assessment and capital allocation methods are implemented in R language,

which can be found in the supplementary materials of this paper. Its practicality is demonstrated

with real data. Practitioners may easily adopt the codes for their company speciﬁc applications.

The overall organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 proposes a tensor-based

loss model for cyber risk assessment, which incorporates the structural information of risk arrival.

Based on the risk assessment results, Section 3 introduces the holistic framework of optimizing

capital allocation for cybersecurity investment and cyber loss reserve. Section 4 provides a case

study that integrates the risk assessment process and the decision making of capital allocation for

cyber risk management. Section 5 concludes and outlines some potential future directions.

2 Cyber Risk Assessment

2.1 Cascade model

B¨ohme et al. (2019) developed a cascade model to describe the arrival of cyber incident, in which

each arrival process is summarized as follows.

(i) Once a threat is initiated by an attacker, it will exploit vulnerabilities in a cyber system.

(ii) The vulnerabilities that are not fully eliminated by security controls will then be the viable

paths for the threat to impact assets in the system.

(iii) Eventually, assets of diﬀerent types and values will generate distinct impacts.

In this paper, we take the inspiration from this model and extend it for cyber risk assessment

and capital management. As summarized in the arrival process, there are ﬁve essential cascade

components in the model; we shall ﬁrst explain their details below and use an example to allude

the relationship among them.

7

• A threat is an action that has the potential of causing damage to a cyber system. They
might be initiated externally by hackers or cyber criminals with malicious intent, or they

could simply be reckless actions performed internally which lead to unintentional damage.

For instance, a common threat for password protected accounts is external dictionary attack,

which utilizes a large pool of possible passwords to guess the correct one by trial and error

until succeeding.

• A vulnerability is a cyber weakness that may be exploited by a threat. A threat alone cannot
induce any harm if it fails to match any vulnerabilities in the system. For example, allowing an

unlimited number of password attempts is a perfect match to the dictionary attack; provided

with suﬃcient computational power, the attacker will eventually get the correct password,

which is only a matter of time.

• A control is a security measure that is designed for patching a vulnerability. If a control is
applied to a vulnerability, the risk of that vulnerability being exploited by the threat(s) will

be reduced. For instance, the company, which is liable to the password protected accounts,

can limit the number of password attempts before an account is temporarily locked, and

hence lengthen the eventually succeeding time of the attacker; it can further enforce multi-

factor authentication, or mandate regular change of passwords to the account holders, as an

additional layer of security.

• An asset is associated with the information technology component of a certain entity, which
can be tangible or intangible. The value of a cyber asset relies on its conﬁdentiality, integrity,

and availability, which are together known as the CIA triad (see Cebula et al. (2014)), and

they are likely to be damaged or completely destroyed in cyber incidents. For example, a

successful password attack would obtain all available private data in a victim account without

permission and being noticed.

• An impact is a materialized loss arising from a cyber asset in a cyber incident. The impact
may consist of various types of costs, such as the direct loss of value of a physical cyber

asset when it becomes inoperable, or the legal cost if there is a lawsuit derived from the

incident. For instance, the successful password attacker might directly thieve any monetary

beneﬁt from the victim account using the data. In this paper, the impact is the base random

variable for developing a cyber loss model.

With these ﬁve key cascade components being clearly deﬁned, Figure 1 visualizes the structure

of the cascade model as well as the relationship among the components. Hereafter, the ﬁrst four
cascade components are occasionally denoted as T, V, C, and A, followed by counting indices; for
example, T1 represents the ﬁrst threat while V4 represents the fourth vulnerability in the system.
Although the impacts are denoted as I in the ﬁgure, we shall use another more conventional notation
for these base random variables.

ﬁrst (resp. third) vulnerability is partially (resp. fully) patched by the ﬁrst (resp. third) control

2.2 Mapping relationships among cascade components

In order to develop the quantitative cyber loss model based on the cascade model, the relationship

among the cascade components must be concisely deﬁned. As we can observe from Figure 1, since

an asset being attacked induces one and only one impact, which shall be characterized by a random

variable, there are only three mappings to be established, where the vulnerability serves as the core

component and relates respectively to the threat, asset, and control. From now on, suppose that

there are l types of threats, m categories of vulnerabilities, and n classes of assets.

• Vulnerability-threat mapping

This is a general many-to-many relationship, where a threat may exploit one or more vulner-

abilities, and a vulnerability may be exploited by one or more threats. It characterizes the

external risk by the intrinsic nature of a cyber event, which could be initiated externally or

performed internally. This mapping is deﬁned by a matrix A, which is of size l × m, such

that, for i = 1, 2, . . . , l and j = 1, 2, . . . , m,

Aij =


1


0


if Vj can be exploited by Ti;

otherwise.

• Vulnerability-asset mapping

This is another general many-to-many relationship, where a vulnerability may associate with

one or more assets, and an asset may be associated with one or more vulnerabilities.

It

characterizes the internal risk by the overall conﬁgurations inside a cyber system. This

mapping is deﬁned by a matrix B of size m × n, such that, for j = 1, 2, . . . , m and k =

9

1, 2, . . . , n,

Bjk =


1


0


if Ak is associated with Vj;

otherwise.

• Vulnerability-control mapping

This is naturally a one-to-one and onto relationship based on the deﬁnition of controls. It

characterizes the eﬀectiveness of each control set in mitigating the corresponding vulnera-
bility. For each vulnerability j = 1, 2, . . . , m, deﬁne θj ∈ [0, 1] be the scaling factor to the
potential loss(es) due to this Vj, after a certain control set Cj is applied. When the vul-
nerability j is only guarded by the control set at the industry standard, θj = 1. Note that
the industry standard, instead of a completely insecure state that no control is applied at all,

is considered in this paper, because many basic controls, such as built-in security features

of many software applications, exist by default and thus an entirely insecure environment is
nowhere to be found. Additional control measure Cj reduces the value of θj; in particular,
when the vulnerability j is fully eliminated, θj = 0. The vulnerability-control mapping is
summarized by the vector θ = [θ1, θ2, . . . , θm].

Since the vulnerabilities are shared across all three mappings, the relationships among threat,

asset, and control can be obtained via composite mappings through the vulnerabilities. These

mapping relationships indeed exist in practice, where cybersecurity controls are proposed to patch

vulnerabilities and block pathways from threats to assets. For example, in the CIS (Center for

Internet Security) Controls framework, CIS (2021) provided a comprehensive relationship between

20 controls and 5 assets; for illustration, the relationship is duplicated in Appendix A. Another

example is that, based on this framework, SANS Institute (2013) did an empirical study, which

maps most of those CIS controls with 25 threats compiled by Verizon Security Research & Cyber

Intelligence Center (2021); the mapping is also repeated in Appendix B for demonstration.

Example 2.1. To plainly illustrate the quantitative cyber loss model, we shall assume the following

smaller mapping matrices to be referred repeatedly for risk assessment in the remaining of Section

2.

2.3 Tensor structure

With the aid of the three deﬁned mappings above, we can deﬁne a single quantity for characterizing

the eﬀect by a cyber event on a controlled cyber system. To this end, for i = 1, 2, . . . , l, j =

1, 2, . . . , m, and k = 1, 2, . . . , n, let

Dijk = AijBjkθj.

(1)

10

This quantity summarizes whether the cyber system is in danger of the cyber event, from the i-th

threat by the j-th controlled vulnerability on the k-th asset, and if so, how extreme the impact is.

• If Dijk = 1, the i-th threat, j-th controlled vulnerability, and k-th asset together will induce
full impact to the system. This is the aggregate result of that Vj is exploited by Ti and that

Ak is associated with Vj, and when no additional, other than industry standard, control Cj

is implemented to patch Vj.

• If 0 < Dijk < 1, the i-th threat, j-th controlled vulnerability, and k-th asset together will
induce partial impact to the cyber system. Note that the partial impact here is deﬁned
relative to the full impact when Dijk = 1, and an impact is considered as partial when
additional controls that exceed the industry-average level are implemented but are not yet

able to completely eliminate the vulnerability.

In this case, Vj is exploited by Ti, Ak is

associated with Vj, and Cj only partially patches Vj.

• If Dijk = 0, the i-th threat, j-th controlled vulnerability, and k-th asset together will not
induce any impact to the system. This is either because, Vj cannot be exploited by Ti, or

Ak is not associated with Vj, or Vj is fully patched by Cj.

The structural information of the cyber cascade model can then be revealed in terms of a tensor

D, of size l × m × n, which shall prove itself useful in developing the quantitative cyber loss model

in later sections. To clearly picture this abstract object, we revisit Example 2.1 as follows.

Figure 2a depicts the tensor in Example 2.1, while Figure 2b summarizes the elements of that

tensor. In the example, as there are 3 types of threats, 3 categories of vulnerabilities, and 3 classes
of assets, the tensor is deﬁned in the ﬁnite set {T1, T2, T3} × {V1, V2, V3} × {A1, A2, A3}, where
× represents the Cartesian product herein. The tensor can be generalized to include the three

mappings by introducing the origin O; indeed, the vulnerability-threat matrix A can be positioned

on the A-plane, which is deﬁned by the coordinates (Ti, Vj, O), while the vulnerability-asset matrix

B can be set on the B-plane, which is deﬁned by the coordinates (O, Vj, Ak); the vulnerability-

control vector θ can be put on the θ-axis, which is deﬁned by the coordinates (O, Vj, O). Finally,

the O-plane, which is deﬁned by the coordinates (Ti, O, Ak) and represents the threat-asset

mapping matrix AB, shall be handy in illustrating the cyber loss model in later sections. Such a

generalization also applies for any ﬁnite set of threats, vulnerabilities, and assets.

2.4 Tensor-based cyber loss model

As pointed out in Section 2.1, an impact from each cyber incident is in fact a base random variable

which models a random loss to the controlled cyber system. The impact depends on two factors.

The ﬁrst one is how the cyber event happens; that is, which threat is acted, either internally

or externally, and in turn which vulnerability is exploited, as well as which asset is consequently

aﬀected; in addition, whether the vulnerability is patched. The ﬁrst factor has been addressed by

the tensor D introduced in the last section, which depends on the controlled cyber system.

The second factor lies in the loss size itself. To this end, for i = 1, 2, . . . , l, j = 1, 2, . . . , m,

ijk be the random variable which represents the raw loss due to a cyber
incident, from the i-th threat by the j-th vulnerability on the k-th asset. Herein, the raw loss

represents a cyber loss which is not further mitigated by additional cybersecurity controls, but is

mitigated by those at the industry-average level. These random variables can be summarized by
another tensor X 0, of size l × m × n.

12

The contingent impact information from the cyber incident to the controlled cyber system of

interest is then given by the element-wise product of the two tensors D and X 0; that is,

X = D ◦ X 0,

(2)

where ◦ stands for the element-wise multiplication between two tensors herein. In particular, if the

cyber incident is from the i-th threat, by the j-th controlled vulnerability, on the k-th asset, the
impact will be given by Xijk = DijkX 0

ijk.

Example 2.2. We revisit Example 2.1 to further illustrate the cyber loss model. While the

structure of the tensor in Figure 3a of Example 2.1 is similar to that in Figure 2a, they are actually

diﬀerent since Figure 3a depicts the loss tensor in which each element is an impact random variable,

as shown in Figure 3b. Therein, the elements are calculated based on Equation (2). For example,

in accordance with Example 2.1, a viable attack path is represented by the red dashed arrows in

Figure 3a, where T3 is acted on V3, which is partially patched by C3, and consequently aﬀects A2.

The impact associated with that path is given by

X332 = D332X 0

332 = A33B32θ3X 0

332 = (1/4) X 0

332.

However, if an attack path is not feasible, such as that T3 exploits V3 but A3 is not associated

with V3, the impact will become null that

X333 = D333X 0

333 = A33B33θ3X 0

333 = (0) X 0

333 = 0,

as B33 = 0, even if the raw random loss X 0

333 is non-zero.

2.5 Aggregate cyber loss

The abstract tensor-based cyber loss model in the last section does not directly provide much

practical use for enterprise risk management purposes. It is, instead, an aggregate cyber loss over a

given time period, say one ﬁscal year, during which multiple cyber incidents might emerge, would

be called desirable to cyber risk managers. On one hand, as we shall see below, the loss model

aggregating across cyber events is not new but based on the well-known collective risk model. On

the other hand, the aggregate loss model for each cyber incident is derived by the loss tensor from

the cascade model, which does not exist in the literature, and is based on, as alluded in Section

2.1, that a cyber event is due to a threat being acted.

2.5.1 Loss model for each cyber incident

We ﬁrst ﬁx a particular cyber event in the given period of time. Let L be the aggregate loss of

that cyber incident. Since each incident is initiated by one and only one threat, the aggregate loss

is given by the sum of mutually exclusive losses, in which each loss is due to a unique threat. To

P (Yi = 1) by pi, and thus (cid:80)l

While the order of the double summations does not matter, we choose to aggregate the impacts

sections, where we shall provide practical reasons for this order. Let also Zik be the random loss
due to the i-th threat on the k-th asset, for i = 1, 2, . . . , l and k = 1, 2, . . . , n; and thus,

Zik =

Revisiting Example 2.1 should ease the understanding of this series of aggregations. Figure 4

illustrates that the impact aggregation across vulnerabilities in (3) can be pictorially understood as

compressing the impact random variables in the loss tensor towards the O-plane. Moreover, from

Figure 4, the additional impact aggregation across assets in (3) can be realized as further compress-

ing the aggregated random losses on the O-plane towards the Ti-axis. Finally, the materialized
aggregate loss in (4) due to the cyber incident picks either Z1, Z2, or Z3 on the Ti-axis.

By (3) and (4), the distribution of aggregate loss of the cyber incident can be obtained by two

convolutions, followed by a mixing:

fZik = fXi1k ∗ fXi2k ∗ · · · ∗ fXimk ,

for i = 1, 2, . . . , l and k = 1, 2, . . . , n;

2.5.2 Collective risk model

Armed with the aggregate loss model for each cyber event, the aggregate loss model over the given

period of time is simply resembling the renowned collective risk model. Let N be a non-negative
random variable which represents the total number of cyber incidents. Let Lr, for r = 1, 2, . . . ,
be a sequence of independent and identically distributed aggregate losses, where Lr represents the
aggregate loss of the r-th cyber incident and follows the distribution of fL given in (6). Assume
that the total number of cyber incidents N is independent of the aggregate losses Lr. Therefore, the
total aggregate loss over the given time period S = (cid:80)N
r=1 Lr, and its probability density function
is given by

fS = lim

˜n
(cid:88)

r=0

(fL1 ∗ fL2 ∗ · · · ∗ fLr ) × pN (r) ,

(7)

where pN (·) is the probability mass function of the random variable N .

For the purpose of cyber capital management in later sections, let Sik be the aggregate loss of
cyber incidents from the i-th threat on the k-th asset over the given time period, where i = 1, 2, . . . , l
and k = 1, 2, . . . , n. It can be expressed as Sik = (cid:80)Nik
ik, where Nik is a non-negative random
variable to represent the number of cyber incidents from the i-th threat on the k-th asset, and Zr
ik,
for r = 1, 2, . . . , is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random losses due to Ti
on Ak, and each Zr
ik represents the random loss of the r-th cyber incident associated with (Ti,Ak)
and follows the distribution of fZik given in (5). The distribution of Sik can be obtained in a similar
manner as in (7), as long as Nik and Zr
k=1 Sik. We,
again, defer providing the practical reasons for this choice of granularity for aggregate loss to the

3 Cyber Capital Management

As in general risk management practice, company managers can make use of the quantitative loss

model developed in the last section to outline capital allocation scheme for the cyber risks. On one

hand, ex-ante investment should be budgeted for improving the existing cybersecurity controls or

implementing new ones in order to mitigate potential cyber losses. On the other hand, ex-post-loss

coverage reserve should be planned to weather the realized extreme cyber losses and to ensure

uninterrupted business operations. While the latter type of capital, i.e., ex-post-loss reserve, has

been extensively studied in the risk management literature for any class of risk, the former type, i.e.,

ex-ante investment, has been seldom discussed in any risk management framework. The following

section utilizes the cyber cascade model proposed in the last section to address the novel ex-ante

investment problem and discusses its relationship with the classical problem of ex-post-loss reserve.

17

3.1 Trade-oﬀ: ex-ante investment versus ex-post-loss reserve

Recall that the cyber cascade model is characterized by the three mappings deﬁned in Section

2.2. The vulnerability-threat and vulnerability-asset mappings are typically determined by the

company’s cyber infrastructure and external factors of cyber actions. Company managers have the

authority to allocate ex-ante investment for cybersecurity controls to revise the vulnerability-control

mapping. Therefore, an impact, i.e., a loss, from each cyber incident can be mitigated through

partially, or even fully, patching the currently existing vulnerabilities, i.e., any remaining vulner-

abilities after industry-standard controls have already been applied, via investment in additional

cybersecurity controls.

Let Mj, for j = 1, 2, . . . , m, be the cybersecurity investment amount to the control Cj for the
vulnerability Vj. The investment amount Mj to the j-th control in turn aﬀects the scaling factor
to the potential loss(es) due to the Vj, which is θj (Mj); in particular, the investment amount
and the scaling factor are inversely proportional to each other, that when the ex-ante investment

is large, the scaling factor becomes small, and vice versa. Since the total aggregate loss S, and
the aggregate loss Sik because of (Ti,Ak), for i = 1, 2, . . . , l and k = 1, 2, . . . , n, over the given
period of time, depend on the scaling vector θ, they are actually driven by the investment vector
M = [M1, M2, . . . , Mm].
S (M) and Sik (M).

In the sequel, we shall write such dependence for the aggregate losses

They guide us to the underlying trade-oﬀ between ex-ante investment and ex-post-loss reserve.

When the management allocates no or little additional capital for the cybersecurity investment

beyond the industry standard, the scaling factor vanishes such that the cyber system experiences

almost full impact from contingent cyber events. In this case, the realized aggregate losses within

the period could be massive, which require the management to plan a tremendous amount of

reserve to absorb losses. For example, in the 2017 WannaCry attack where the threat is encrypting

ransomware, many organizations were exposed to it because of their lack of data recovery capability,

which is the exploited vulnerability in such events. However, this vulnerability could have been

easily patched by relatively low cost preventative measures such as reliable backups for important

data, and thus the materialized impact of the attack could have been substantially reduced, which

leads to a lower cost of business or production recovery from data inaccessibility. This corresponds

to the left side of the curve in Figure 5, which resembles the well-known Laﬀer curve, where a

marginal increase in cybersecurity investment can signiﬁcantly reduce the expected amount of

spending on recovery after cyber incidents, and reduce the total allocated capital.

However, this does not necessarily imply that the cyber risk manager should fully allocate

capital for cybersecurity investment only. The well-known Gordon-Loeb model (see Gordon and

Loeb (2002) and Gordon et al. (2016)) states that the marginal beneﬁt, in terms of the reduction

of reserve, decreases for each unit of cybersecurity investment. Therefore, as pointed out by Ruan

(2019), if the total allocated capital is to be minimized, there will be a certain level of cybersecurity

investment such that any additional investment allocation is not worthy for such small marginal

return. This corresponds to the right side of the curve in Figure 5.

3.2 Optimal capital allocation

How to ﬁnd the sweetspot for the ex-ante investment and ex-post-loss reserve trade-oﬀ should be

one of the key elements to be considered in any cyber capital management practice. Regarding

the targets of investments, there is no ambiguity that they should be cybersecurity controls that

patch vulnerabilities. However, the company could make reserves for diﬀerent classes of targets.

For example, the company could set aside funds for individual assets, e.g., separate reserves for

data and physical assets. Similarly, reserves could be prepared speciﬁc to diﬀerent threats. In this

paper, we follow some existing practices in the cybersecurity and the cyber insurance industries.

Cyber risk management tools, such as the Thrivaca model by Arx Nimbus, LLC. (2021), oﬀer their

clients the estimation of cyber losses at the granularity of threat-asset pairs. Moreover, since one

could perceive reserve as a kind of self-insurance, assigning reserves to threat-asset pairs is in line
with the common practice in cyber insurance policies. For example, the CyberOne TM Coverage
oﬀered by Hartford Steam Boiler (2017) covers cyber losses resulting from diﬀerent attacks, such

as malware and denial-of-service attacks, which are various types of threats, and the covered losses

include data and system restoration costs, which arise from various classes of assets. Therefore,
as alluded in Section 2, the reserve is allocated to the aggregate loss Sik (M) due to (Ti,Ak), for
i = 1, 2, . . . , l, and k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

In addition, there are two other common conﬂicting interests and priorities in a general cap-

ital management framework, which we review as follows and shall provide detailed account after

formulating the optimal capital allocation problem.

• (Standalone and corporate allocations) Naturally, the management has to budget total capital
at the whole corporate level which concerns the aggregate loss S (M). For project ﬁnanc-

ing, performance measure, and regulatory supervision purposes, the management also has to

allocate reserve at standalone levels.

19

• (Loss-reserve matching and reduction in opportunity cost) On one hand, the cyber risk man-
ager should plan and allocate reserve at both corporate and standalone levels such that they

do not deviate much from the realized aggregate losses. On the other hand, reserve needs

to be kept as liquid assets, such as cash and money market funds, which typically yield lit-

tle return; the liquidity requirement indirectly causes an opportunity cost, which should be

minimized.

In order to achieve those three compromises altogether, we propose to apply the holistic principle

by Chong et al. (2021), which allows the manager to solve the cyber capital allocation as one single

optimization problem; see also its recent application to pandemic resources management in Chen

et al. (2021).

which measure the deviation of realized aggregate losses from the allocated reserve intended

20

to cover the losses; the family of such functions are summarized in Furman and Zitikis (2008),

Dhaene et al. (2012), and Chong et al. (2021).

The holistic cyber capital allocation solved by (8) shall indeed take those three equilibriums

into account, which can also be read from various pieces in the objective function.

• (Standalone and corporate allocations) The standalone allocation scheme is represented by
1 , where investments on cybersecurity controls and reserves as losses buﬀer are balanced on

the level of vulnerabilities and threat-asset pairs. In contrast, 2 represents the corporate

allocation scheme, in which the total investment and reserve are determined in the equilibrium.

• (Loss-reserve matching and reduction in opportunity cost) The matchings are given in 5 for
standalone allocations, and in 8 for corporate allocation. They are achieved by minimizing

the mismatching cost, which is the weighted expected deviance between the realized aggregate

loss and the allocated reserve for covering the loss. The deviance is given in the quadratic

form since cyber incidents might cause ripple eﬀects, as described in University of Oxford and

Axis (2020), which could lead to additional losses if the initial impact cannot be well contained

due to the lack of reserve. Therefore, the relationship between loss-reserve mismatching and

its cost should be non-linear. For instance, if a cyber attack disrupts the production lines

of a manufacturer, and there is not suﬃcient fund for resuming the operation promptly, the

manufacturer may face additional contractual liabilities for the late delivery of products. As

for minimizing the opportunity cost for holding liquid assets as reserve, they are represented

by 4 for standalone allocations, and by 7 for corporate allocation.

• (Ex-ante investment and ex-post-loss reserve) The trade-oﬀ between investment and reserve
introduced in Section 3.1 is also weighed in. The costs of cybersecurity investment are given in

3 for standalone allocations, and in 6 for corporate allocation, whereas the reserve costs are

4 and 5 together, as well as 7 and 8 together. Note that the cost of reserve incorporates

the consideration for the balancing between suﬃcient loss reserve and economical opportunity

cost, as discussed in the last point.

3.3 Holistic cyber capital allocation

The capital allocation problem in (8) can be solved in two steps. First, for each ex-ante investment
allocation M ∈ M, the optimal ex-post-loss reserve allocation K∗ ∈ K, which depends on the ﬁxed
investment M, is solved from (8) without the objective terms 3 and 6 . Then, the optimal reserve
K∗ (M) is substituted back into (8), which is solved for the optimal investment M∗. Consequently,
the optimal investment and reserve allocation is given by the pair (M∗, K∗ (M∗)). The ﬁrst step
was partially resolved in Chong et al. (2021), while we shall herein impose an additional total

budget constraint for investments and reserves together. As pointed out in Smeraldi and Malacaria

(2014), most organizations do not have the fund to implement strong security, and thus cyber

risk management decisions can only be made with a limited budget in most cases. For the optimal

21

investment M∗ in the second step, a pairwise comparison between admissible investment allocations
shall again shed light on the trade-oﬀ between ex-ante investment and ex-post-loss reserve. In the

sequel, an investment or a reserve is admissible as long as it is non-negative, which should be

practically assumed.

3.3.1 Optimal ex-post-loss reserve

Throughout this subsection, ﬁx a non-negative investment allocation M such that M ≤ β, where β

is the total budget for investment and reserve allocations. We shall ﬁrst present the unconstrained
solution, i.e., when K = Rl×n in (8), as it shall lead us on how to solve the optimal reserve with
constraints. In this paper, two sets of constraints shall be considered for practicality. We ﬁrst show

how reserves should be determined if they are only subject to the non-negativity requirement, and

then, in addition, a total budget constraint is assumed.

Unconstrained case With K = Rl×n, the optimal ex-post-loss reserve (cid:101)K∗ (M) is given by, for
any i(cid:48) = 1, 2, . . . , l, and k(cid:48) = 1, 2, . . . , n,

(cid:101)K∗

for its proof, see Chong et al. (2021). These four components constituting the optimal and corporate
reserves are respectively the optimal standalone reserve Ki(cid:48)k(cid:48) (M), the optimal corporate reserve
K (M), and harmonic weights (cid:102)Wi(cid:48)k(cid:48), (cid:102)W . Note that (cid:102)W + (cid:80)l
k=1 (cid:102)Wik = 1. The optimal
standalone reserve describes the amount planned to a particular threat-asset pair (Ti(cid:48), Ak(cid:48)) if it
were the only pair to be allocated with reserve. When νi(cid:48)k(cid:48) is relatively larger than ωi(cid:48)k(cid:48), i.e., it is
more costly to allocate reserve for the threat-asset pair (Ti(cid:48), Ak(cid:48)), in terms of the opportunity cost
over the loss-reserve mismatching cost, its optimal reserve is reduced. Similar interpretations hold

(cid:80)n

i=1

for the optimal corporate reserve. The harmonic weights represent the competition among optimal
standalone reserves and the optimal corporate reserve. When ωi(cid:48)k(cid:48) is relatively larger than the
other ωik and ω, the corresponding harmonic weight (cid:102)Wi(cid:48)k(cid:48) is small, and thus the optimal reserve

22

inclines to its own optimal standalone reserve.

Constrained case: non-negative reserves Let us discuss the case when the non-negativity
constraint, i.e., K = Rl×n
+ , is imposed. On one hand, if all of the unconstrained optimal ex-
post-loss reserve solved in (9) satisfy the constraint, they are also optimal for the constrained

case. On the other hand, if some of the unconstrained reserve solved in (9) do not satisfy the

constraint, they should instead be assigned by the lower bound as reserve, which is zero in this

setting. Hence, these threat-asset pairs should not compete with other pairs, as well as the whole

corporate, for reserve resources, and this should be reﬂected in the revised harmonic weights which

exclude those non-competing threat-asset pairs. However, before all of the constrained optimal

constraint are not known a priori. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary variable Iik, for i =

Constrained case: non-negative reserves with total budget For many businesses, there

could only be a limited amount of capital devoted to cyber risk management, which may not be

suﬃcient to meet the reserving scheme given by Equation (11). Since β ≥ 0 is the total budget for

investment and reserve allocations, for the ﬁxed investment allocation M, the remaining budget

for ex-post-loss reserves is b (M) := β − M . Together with the non-negative reserve constraint,

3.3.2 Optimal ex-ante investment

With the ex-post-loss reserve being optimized given by (12), the total cost (8), which depends on

the ex-ante investment for cybersecurity controls, involves two parts:

• the residual cost of reserve

• the cost of cybersecurity investment

(13)

(14)

Therefore, for any two non-negative investment allocations Mp, Mq ∈ M ⊆ Rm

+ ∩ {M|M ≤ β},

the investment Mp is better oﬀ than the other investment Mq if

gr (Mq) − gr (Mp) ≥ gc (Mp) − gc (Mq) .

This inequality echoes again the trade-oﬀ between ex-ante investment and ex-post-loss reserve.
Suppose that Mq is an existing investment allocation for the cybersecurity controls, while Mp is
an exploring allocation strategy. The inequality entails that, if the reduction of the residual cost
of reserve is more than the additional cost of cybersecurity investment, the new allocation Mp is

24

worthy. Generally speaking, this is because the marginal beneﬁt outweighs the marginal cost. This

is perfectly in line with the advocate in cybersecurity investment literature, such as Cavusoglu et al.

(2004), Gordon and Loeb (2002), and Ruan (2019), that an investment should not be made if it

does not generate more beneﬁt than the investment cost itself.

4 Case Study

This section provides a proof of concept case study to illustrate the cyber risk assessment and capital

management framework proposed in this paper. A historical cyber incident dataset acquried from

the Advisen Ltd.

is used for the demonstration. The dataset contains 103, 061 cyber incidents.

There are 125 variables coded for each incident, which can be classiﬁed into four categories; they

are

(i) the information of a victim company,

(ii) the nature of an incident,

(iii) the consequences of the incident, and

(iv) the information of any associated lawsuits.

Since the proposed framework can apply to any particular cyber system, we select a victim

company from the dataset as a representative example, which has the most observations, for this

case study. The large volume of data oﬀers a comprehensive review of vulnerabilities and aﬀected

assets. As external observers in this study, we can only have limited access to information about

any particular ﬁrm’s cyber systems, hence the ﬁrm with the most publicly available information

is preferably chosen for illustration purposes. This selection criterion is not required for the real-

world application of this framework, given that a corporation can conduct a complete assessment

of its cybersecurity settings to learn about its threats, vulnerabilities, and assets. For conﬁdential

courtesy, we shall refer the victim company as Company X in the sequel.

4.1 Loss tensor

To assess the cyber risk of Company X, we need to ﬁrst identify all possible threats, vulnerabilities,

and assets, as well as their mapping relationships, for its underlying cyber system. However, the

acquired dataset from the Advisen Ltd. does not contain any sensitive information of a victim

company, such as its internal conﬁguration nor external exposure. Therefore, we assume that the

historical cyber incidents of the victim company have exhaustively covered all possible Ti, Vj, and

Ak, for i = 1, 2, . . . , l, j = 1, 2, . . . , m, and k = 1, 2, . . . , n, as well as the mapping matrices A

and B. As a consequence, we implicitly assume that the victim company could not fully patch

the vulnerabilities by only industry-average cybersecurity controls in the past, which is usually the

case in practice.

For the Company X, there are l = 2 types of threats, m = 3 categories of vulnerabilities, and

n = 2 classes of assets, which are summarized in Table 1.

Together with the cybersecurity controls θ = [θ1, θ2, θ3], which shall be determined later by the

4.2 Aggregate loss

To obtain the distributions of the aggregate losses, S and Sik, for i = 1, 2, and k = 1, 2, for the
purpose of capital allocation, we need to ﬁrst model the severity for the raw random losses, as

well as the frequency for the numbers of cyber incidents. As alluded from the loss tensor of the
Company X in Figure 6, it suﬃces to model the losses X 0
222. Moreover, from Figure

212, and X 0

131, X 0

26

6, since Z12 = X112 + X122 + X132 = 0 and Z21 = X211 + X221 + X231 = 0, regardless of the realized
values of N12 and N21, we have S12 = S21 = 0; and thus, it suﬃces to model the total number of
cyber incidents N , and the numbers of cyber events, N11 and N22, for the threat-asset pairs (T1,
A1) and (T2, A2), of the Company X.

Recall that a raw cyber loss should be independent of the company of interest; therefore, all

independent cyber losses from the historical incidents, which emerged in the industry where the

Company X lies in, are used for statistical inference purposes. Table 2 provides their summary

statistics from the dataset.

Table 2: Summary statistics of industry-wide cyber losses

From the summary statistics, we can easily infer that zero-inﬂated models are necessary for

ﬁtting these three raw losses well. For the parts of positive loss, several heavy-tailed distributions,

such as log-normal, Pareto and Weibull distributions, are considered. It turns out that Weibull

distribution provides the best ﬁt. Table 3 shows the results of Pearson’s chi-square tests and their

corresponding statistical signiﬁcances with respect to the signiﬁcance level 0.05.

Table 4: Estimated parameters of zero-inﬂated Weibull distributions for raw cyber losses

The ﬁtted zero-inﬂated Weibull distributions are then discretized for preparing the two convolutions
and the mixture in (5) and (6), in which the probabilities p1 and p2 of the mutually exclusive
occurrence of T1 and T2 for the Company X are respectively estimated as 0.015 and 0.985.

We ﬁx one ﬁscal year for the capital allocation purpose. Therefore, the acquired dataset with

the historical cyber incidents for the Company X from 1997 to 2017 induce 21 observations for each
frequency random variable N , N11, and N22. We assume that they follow the Poisson distribution.
By the maximum likelihood estimation, the estimated means of these three frequency random

variables are 6.48, 0.1, and 6.38 respectively.

Finally, as the distribution of the frequency random variables lies in the (a, b, 0) class, we make

use of the well-known Panjer recursion to obtain the distributions of the total aggregate loss S, as
well as the threat-asset pairing aggregate losses S11 and S22.

4.3 Capital Allocation

First of all, since S12 (M) = S21 (M) = 0 for any M ∈ M, and due to the non-negativity constraint,
it is obvious that the optimal ex-post-loss reserve K∗
21 (M∗) = 0, regardless of the
optimal ex-ante investment M∗.

12 (M∗) = K∗

We assume that the manager either, invests a ﬁxed amount M j, or does not allocate any
investment, to the cybersecurity control Cj, in addition to the industry-average level, for the
vulnerability Vj, for j = 1, 2, . . . , m. As a result, if M = M j, the losses due to Vj are scaled
by θj ∈ (0, 1), i.e., the j-th vulnerability is partially, but not fully, patched; if M = 0, the Vj
is only guarded by the industry-standard control, and thus θj = 1 that the Company X shall
experience full impact from the raw losses due to Vj for its vulnerable cyber system. Therefore,
(cid:9), where × represents
the set of admissible investment allocation M = (cid:8)0, M 1
the Cartesian product herein; and thus, there are eight possible investment allocations Mp, for
p = 1, 2, . . . , 8, with the corresponding eight possible cybersecurity control vectors θp, which in
turn aﬀects the distribution of the impacts via (15), as well as that of the aggregate losses S (Mp),
S11 (Mp), and S22 (Mp).

(cid:9) × (cid:8)0, M 3

(cid:9) × (cid:8)0, M 2

As mentioned in Section 3.3, the optimal ex-post-loss reserves K∗

22 (Mp) shall ﬁrst
be solved for each investment allocation Mp, for p = 1, 2, . . . , 8; and the optimal ex-ante investment
M∗ ∈ M shall then be solved by minimizing the sum of the residual cost of reserve in (13) and
the cost of cybersecurity investment in (14), among the eight possible investment allocations. The

11 (Mp) and K∗

28

weighted penalty functions for deviances at individual threat-asset pairs and the aggregate deviance

are chosen to be

hik(Sik(M)) =

1{Sik(M)>VaR0.9(Sik(M))}
P (Sik(M) > VaR0.9(Sik(M)))

,

for i = 1, 2 and k = 1, 2, and

h(S(M)) =

1{S(M)>VaR0.9(S(M))}
P (S(M) > VaR0.9(S(M)))

,

respectively, where VaR0.9(·) is the Value-at-Risk of a random variable measured at conﬁdence level
of 90%. Correspondingly, the reserve that minimizes the weighted expected deviance is measured

by the Tail Value-of-Risk at the same conﬁdence level. Moreover, the following are the parameters
for cybersecurity investment and control in this case study: M 1 = 2×106 ($2 Million), M 2 = 8×106
($8 Million), M 3 = 106 ($1 Million), and θ1 = θ2 = θ3 = 0.2. The relative importance weights
ηj, νik, ωI

ik, η, ν, and ωI are set as 1; that is, all objectives are equally important.
In the following, we explain a practical choice for the unit-exchange weights, ωE
the optimality, the marginal decrease of the unit-exchanged weighted expected deviance,

ik and ωE. At

ωEE (cid:2)(cid:0)S(M) − K)2h(S(M)(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

coincides with the marginal increase of the opportunity cost of ex-post-loss reserve, K, and thus

deduces a reasonable unit-exchange weight. However, the optimal ex-post-loss reserve is not known

a priori when the unit-exchange weight is set. Hence, we propose to set the weight by equating the

average marginal decrease of the unit-exchanged weighted expected deviance with the (average)

marginal increase of the opportunity cost of ex-post-loss reserve, K. The average is taken at two

extreme ex-post-loss reserve allocations; the ﬁrst one is zero reserve, which is derived when only

the objective of opportunity cost is considered; the second one is the optimal standalone reserve
ˆK := E [S(M)h(S(M))], which is derived when only the objective of unit-exchanged weighted
expected deviance is considered. See Figure 7 for its pictorial illustration. Therefore,

ωEE(cid:2)(S(M) − 0)2h(S(M))(cid:3) − ωEE(cid:2)(S(M) − ˆK)2h(S(M))(cid:3)
ˆK − 0

= 1,

which yields ωE =
1
E[Sik(M)hik(Sik(M))] .

E[S(M)h(S(M))] . Similarly, we propose that, for i = 1, 2 and k = 1, 2, ωE

ik =

1

Without budget constraint

We shall ﬁrst assume that Company X has a suﬃciently large budget to satisfy the needs for all

ex-ante investments and ex-post-loss reserves. Table 5 summarizes the ﬁndings. Therein, each row

shows the corresponding investment allocations, cybersecurity controls, and the optimal reserves

for the threat-asset pairs (T1,A1) and (T2,A2), as well as the residual cost of reserve and the cost

of cybersecurity investment. The highlighted column indicates the case with the optimal ex-ante

Figure 7: Equating average marginal changes of objectives to determine unit-exchange weight

investments which minimize the sum of the two costs; in this case, the ﬁrst and third vulnerabilities

of the Company X are additionally patched while the second one is left as being guarded only by

an industry-average control.

To understand this result, we shall consider the following two questions: 1) why should the com-
pany make investments to patch V1 and V3? 2) why should the company not invest in mitigating
V2?

For the ﬁrst question, given the cascade model, it is easy to see that V3 is the only link
between T1 and A1, and therefore, mitigating V3 results in a signiﬁcant reduction in the loss on
the threat-asset pair (T1, A1). That further cuts the optimal reserve allocated on that pair by
11 (Mp), for p = 1, 2, 3, 4) to near $0.7 million (see
more than 50%, from around $1.5 million (see K∗
K∗
11 (Mp), for p = 5, 6, 7, 8). Suggested by the comparison between a strategy that has a non-zero
M p
3 and the one that does not, e.g., M5 and M1, The overall beneﬁt of investing in V3, in terms
of the reduction in weighted reserves and weighted expected deviances, is gr(M1) − gr(M5) = 5.19,
whereas the increase in weighted costs of cybersecurity investment is only gc(M5) − gc(M1) = 2.
Since the beneﬁt outweighs the cost, investing in V3 is a rational business decision when reserves
are allocated following the holistic principle.

In contrast, for the loss on threat-asset pair (T2, A2), two paths can cause such an impact
via vulnerability V1 and V2, and the magnitudes of their raw impacts are comparable (see Table
2). Therefore, patching either of them only contributes to a fractional decrease in the required
reserve on (T2, A2). For example, 1 − K∗
22(M7)
22(M5) = 7.1%, which are both
K∗
K∗
much smaller than the aforementioned 50%. The optimal reserve on that threat-asset pair is only
signiﬁcantly reduced when both V1 and V2 are mitigated (see K∗
22 (M8)). However, by following
the cost-beneﬁt analysis as previously done for V3, we observe that only investing in V1 generates
suﬃcient reduction in residual cost of reserve gr(M5) − gr(M6) = 13.6 to cover the additional cost

22(M5) = 26.4% and 1 − K∗

Table 5: Comparison between diﬀerent investment and capital allocation strategies without total
budget constraint.

in cybersecurity investment gc(M6) − gc(M5) = 4, and that is not the case when investment is
made for only V2 or both V and V2, given that M 2 the cost of implementing the control of V2 is
extraordinarily high, and that answers why Company X should not invest in V2.

With budget constraint

We also consider the scenario that Company X has a ﬁxed budget for ex-ante investments and

ex-post-loss reserves, which may not be adequate for some of the strategies summarized in Table
5. Table 6 shows the corresponding result if the ﬁxed amount of budget β is assumed to be $10
million.

Several observations diﬀerent from the case without the budget constraint are worth noting. One
immediate consequence of imposing the budget constraint is that M8 becomes infeasible because
the total required ex-ante investment in cybersecurity exceeds the budget limit. In addition, the

optimum achieved by each allocation strategy is higher than its counterpart without the budget

constraint, since attaining a lower value requires additional capital, which, however, is not available

in this scenario.

In sum, Table 5 and Table 6, as ﬁnal results yielded by the proposed framework in this pa-

per, oﬀer business decision makers an intuitive and eﬀective way to compare between diﬀerent

cybersecurity investment and reserve allocation strategies.

5 Concluding Remarks and Future Directions

In this paper, a cyber cascade model has been proposed for cyber risk assessment and capital

management. Classical actuarial and economic models of cyber risks often focus on data trend

analysis and do not capture distinct features of cyber risk from other risks. In contrast, engineering

literature tends to oﬀer microscopic examination of cyber risks, such as attack graphs, which makes

it diﬃcult to measure ﬁnancial impact at a macro level. The model presented in this paper utilizes

structural properties of cybersecurity to analyze the cyber risk, through the interactions of threat,

vulnerability, control, asset, resulting in ﬁnancial impact. As an application, we develop capital

allocation scheme in both ex-ante investment and ex-post-loss reserve. To deal with the trade-

oﬀ between cybersecurity investment and weathering reserve, as well as to balance the classical

competing interests and priorities in enterprise risk management, the optimal ex-ante investment

and ex-post-loss reserve allocations are solved via the holistic approach. We particularly shed light

on the cost-and-beneﬁt analysis between cybersecurity investment and reduction of after-reserve

residual risk in this paper.

Throughout this study, the focus is on cyber losses with quantiﬁable values. Some losses, such

as the loss of reputation, are diﬃcult to estimate owing to the lack of historical data. However,

the proposed framework would still be applicable if those losses are quantiﬁed using alternative

approaches. For example, for reputational losses, it could possibly be estimated using a business

analytics approach based on assumptions about the impact of reputation on future cash ﬂows or

equity value changes. For other losses, of which the stakes are usually considered too high to analyze

from a cost-beneﬁt perspective, such as impacts on national security, a cost-beneﬁt argument can

32

be made nevertheless, by stating that beneﬁts are so high that any cost is worthwhile.

Several parts of this paper could be further studied. First, we assume that ﬁnancial losses due

to a vulnerability can be linearly reduced by implementing a control. It is possible in practice that

the control does not scale down the losses but increases the probability of zero loss; in this case,

the loss tensor is no longer an element-wise multiplication of the cascade model tensor and the raw

loss tensor. But rather one needs to modify the impact with point mass at zero loss. Second, the

use of cyber insurance could be further explored. In that case, a part of the ex-ante investment is

made in purchasing insurance coverage, in addition to cybersecurity improvement. Then, because

a part of the risk is shared with an insurer, the company only needs ex-post-loss reserves for any

retained losses. Third, the case study in this paper is based on the publicly acquirable dataset

developed and maintained by the Advisen Ltd. which could not reveal sensitive information of

victim companies like internal conﬁguration for vulnerabilities, implemented controls, and assets,

as well as external exposure for threats. Therefore, we make disputable assumptions for illustrative

purposes of the case study. In practice, when implementing the proposed framework, companies

could avoid making these assumptions and establish the links among threats, vulnerabilities, and

assets based on their own actual cybersecurity conditions.
