Abstract—Traditional Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) were
not built with cybersecurity in mind. They operated on sepa-
rate Operational Technology (OT) networks. As these systems
now become more integrated with Information Technology
(IT) networks based on IP, they expose vulnerabilities that
can be exploited by the attackers through these IT networks.
The attackers can control such systems and cause behavior
that jeopardizes the performance and safety measures that
were originally designed into the system. In this paper,
we explore the approaches to identify threats to CPSs and
ensure the quality of the created threat models. The study
involves interviews with eleven security experts working
in security consultation companies, software engineering
companies, an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM),
and ground and areal vehicles integrators. We found through
these interviews that the practitioners use a combination of
various threat modeling methods, approaches, and standards
together when they perform threat modeling of given CPSs.
Key challenges practitioners face are: they cannot transfer
the threat modeling knowledge that they acquire in a cyber-
physical domain to other domains, threat models of modiﬁed
systems are often not updated, and the reliance on mostly
peer-evaluation and quality checklists to ensure the quality
of threat models. The study warns about the difﬁculty to
develop secure CPSs and calls for research on developing
practical threat modeling methods for CPSs, techniques for
continuous threat modeling, and techniques to ensure the
quality of threat models.

I. Introduction

In the past, CPSs operated on their own networks,
which were separated or air-gapped from the corporate
IT networks. The OT and IT networks started converging
in response to the need to provide data and insights
to stakeholders on IT networks. The challenge with
integrating these technologies is the velocity of change: IT
technologies tend to change very frequently, and updates
or patches can be readily done while OT technologies
have a considerably longer shelf life. Legacy security
concerns when OT technologies were initially deployed
can be signiﬁcantly different from the present security
concerns. Trying to capture this disparity is done, in part,
through threat modeling.

Until recently, attackers needed physical access to CPSs.
The trend of integrating these systems to IP networks and
the internet for services, such as remote car diagnostic
and cooperative adaptive cruise control, has extended
the attack surface. The goals of attacks on cyber-physical
systems, such as Stuxnet and Triton, are often not to

breach the conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of the
system’s data but to make the target system perform
activities other than the ones planned and expected by
the original designers. Hence changing the actual process
and unleaching damaging consequences.

Threat modeling is a "systematic exploration technique
to expose any circumstance or event having the potential
to cause harm to a system in the form of destruction,
disclosure, modiﬁcation of data, or denial of service" [1].
It is an approach for identifying potential threats to a
given software and suggesting mitigations. In this paper,
we will not discuss mitigations and limit the scope to
threats only.

There are several methods for threat modeling, in-
cluding threat tree, attack tree, STRIDE, and abuse
cases [2]. Xiong and Lagerstrom surveyed threat modeling
literature. The authors of many of the surveyed papers
validated their proposed approaches (22 out of the 54
selected papers) using, for example, case studies, and
simulation while only two papers used real-word appli-
cations [3]. Most of these methods have been designed
for information systems where the assets are data at rest
and in-transit. The focus on data within the IT network
is an important one. Threat modeling of OT components
can often be physically dangerous, expensive, or even
unrealistic. Therefore, looking at the problem from a
data-centric perspective can help to identify the data ﬂow
early before it gets to the OT technology but may not be
sufﬁcient to identify misuses of CPSs.

There is a lack of systematic threat modeling methods
for CPSs and a gap between the literature and the practice
of threat modeling of CPSs. This paper aims to address
that by answering the question: What are the practices of
threat modeling of cyber-physical systems by cyber-security
experts? To address this question, we interviewed eleven
security experts who perform threat modeling of cyber-
physical systems in their respective organizations. Then,
we transcribed the interviews, extracted the main infor-
mation, and grouped them into themes, and analyzed
the ﬁndings. We found that:

1) the practitioners use a combination of threat mod-
eling methods, approaches, and standards, together,
when performing threat modeling of cyber-physical
systems,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2) organizations often do not update the threat models

of their modiﬁed cyber-physical systems,

3) there is no effective method for ensuring the quality
of threat models besides peer-evaluation and quality
checklists.

4) the practitioners face several challenges when per-
forming threat modeling of cyber-physical systems,
including the difﬁculty to transfer the threat mod-
eling knowledge they acquire in a cyber-physical
domain to other domains.

The results of this work could be used by orga-
nizations when performing threat modeling of cyber-
physical systems and by academia to develop solutions
and techniques that help practitioners perform threat
modeling efﬁciently.

This paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses
related works, Section III describes the research approach,
Section IV presents the results of the study, Section V
summarizes the study results and discusses the impacts
and limitations of the study, and Section VI concludes
the paper.

II. Related Work
This section discusses related work on the security of

CPSs and threat modeling methods and standards.
Security of CPSs. Security issues of CPSs has been
studied for several years. For instance, Alguliyev et
al. [4] analyzed the main types of attacks and threats
of CPSs and proposed a tree of attacks that includes
the attacks on sensing, actuation, computing, commu-
nication, and feedback loops; Lu et al. [5] proposed a
framework of CPSs security, which includes the security
objectives, approaches, and applications of CPSs; and
Pakizeh proposed a framework that aims to understand
the cyber attacks and related risk of different elements
of CPSs [6]. In addition, using the expert knowledge on
security aspects, such as the form of attacks, attacker
positions, operating systems, and routing permissions
klaudel and Rataj [7] proposed an attack graph that
describes the software and hardware of a CPS and their
mutual mapping with security artifacts and a workﬂow
that automates the construction of a vulnerability model
of a CPS that is used to quantitatively analyze the threat
models of the CPSs, and estimate their exploitation costs.
The concern in security in IT is the reduction of mone-
tary losses and is the safety of people and controllability
of the systems, besides the reduction of monetary losses,
in the case of CPSs [8]. Sabaliauskaite and Mathur [9]
proposed the integration of safety and security life-cycle
processes and a model that uniﬁes the attack tree and
the fault tree and their countermeasures. Dong et al. [10]
proposed security and safety framework, and security
framework that focuses on the security of information
and controllability of the CPSs.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) developed a CPS framework to assist in devel-

oping secure and safe CPSs [11]. The security concern
of the framework is to protect CPSs from unauthorized
accesses, change damages, and destruction in addition to
the CIA triad, and the safety concern is preventing nega-
tive consequences of cyber attacks on the stakeholders,
including life, health, property, data, and damage to the
physical environment.
Threat Modeling methods and standards. There exist
several works on threat modeling for CPSs [3]. For
instance, Martins et al. [12] proposed a tool for systematic
analysis of threat models that includes sketching meta-
model of the system using GME, deﬁning the data-ﬂow
and its attribute, and identifying the vulnerabilities that
may exist in the data-ﬂow connections. Also, Khan et
al. [13] adapted the STRIDE method for CPSs by focusing
on the data-ﬂow between the components of the system,
which demonstrated promising results when applied to a
case study as it identiﬁes the vulnerabilities at cyber sub-
systems and their potential consequences on the physical
components of the system. In addition, Casola et al. [14]
developed a threat catalog that consists of known threats
affecting different components of IoT and classiﬁed them
based on asset types.

Several researchers acknowledged the impact of ap-
plication domains on the threat modeling of CPSs. For
instance, Meyer et al. [15] proposed an attack tree to
threat model building and home automation systems in
order to identify security faults either in implementation
or deployment, and Suleiman et al. [16] developed
a comprehensive threat modeling by integrating the
results of smart grid system security threat analysis with
the reference architecture of smart grid including the
components and communication among them.

The International Standards Organization (ISO) and
SAE International released standard ISO/SAE 21434-
Road vehicles cybersecurity engineering to address the
need in cybersecurity engineering of electrical and
electronic systems within road vehicles. The standard
provides guidelines to integrate cybersecurity concerns
in product development, and perform cybersecurity
assessment and monitoring, and develop policies to
handle cybersecurity incidents.

This paper addresses the gap between the development
of threat modeling methods, techniques, and standards
and the practice of threat modeling of CPSs.

III. Research Approach

This study aims to explore the practice of threat
modeling of CPSs in the industry. The data source of the
study comes from interviewing a set of security experts
practicing threat modeling. Figure 1 illustrates the process
of the study, which has three phases: study preparation,
data collection, and data analysis. The descriptions of the
phases follow.

A. Study Preparation

The description of the study preparation follows.
Interview protocol. We reviewed the literature on threat
modeling of a CPS. We used the knowledge that we
acquired to develop a questionnaire protocol. We spec-
iﬁed the research goal with the project sponsor and
formulated a set of open-ended interview questions. The
questionnaire was tested by trial runs with team members
and revised based on the feedback. The set of questions
consists of eleven open-ended questions–Open-ended
questions encourage the participants to provide detailed
responses.
Participants selection. We invited a set of security experts
working in cyber-security companies. Eleven participants
accepted our requests and participated in the study
with the goal to contribute to science, not to represent
their employers. Table I shows the experience of each
participant on threat modeling and the business of their
employers. Among the participants, three work for major
software development companies and ﬁve work for major
companies that develop CPSs.

B. Data Collection

The data collection consists of two sub-phases: con-
ducting the interviews and transcribing the interviews.
The descriptions of these sub-phases follow.
Conducting the interview. We scheduled a one-hour
meeting with each expert. The meetings were held
through Zoom and Web-ex because the interviewers and

participants are located in different places. The interviews
were conducted by one of the authors. The interviewer
explained to each of the interviewees at the beginning of
each of the meetings the goal of the project, the interview
process and requested the consent of the participant to
record the interview.
Transcription of the interviews. The interviews were
transcribed using oTranscribe 1 and Otter.ai. 2.

C. Data Analysis

Interview coding. We used the thematic analysis method
for the interview coding [17]. Thematic analysis is "a
method for identifying, analyzing and reporting patterns
within data" [18]. It allows researchers to explore phenom-
ena through interviews, stories, and observations [19].

Interview coding uses the interview transcripts as
the input and outputs codes that identify the aspects
mentioned during the interviews. A code is a word or
short phrase identifying the essence of a portion of text.
At the end of this step, we assigned codes to each of the
eleven interview transcripts. For example, we assigned

code security properties/goal to the text "When it comes
to the CPSs, the availability of the system matters a lot".
Codes that were semantically similar across transcripts
were consolidated. We used Atlas.ti 3 tool to code the
interviews.
Data extraction and classiﬁcation. Similar codes are
grouped into themes. A theme generalizes a set of codes
belonging to a given concept. The process of assigning
themes to codes was done for each transcript. Table II
lists the themes and associated categories.
Analysis of the results. From the code groups, we
identiﬁed information on security properties, threat busi-
ness impacts, threat modeling approaches, and method,
threat modeling details activity, continuous threat model-
ing approach, threat identiﬁcation methods, continuous
threat modeling approaches, risk assessment approaches,
quality assurance approaches, roles involved in threat
modeling, tools, and challenges. We then modeled the
relationships among these themes.

IV. Data analysis

This section describes the themes that we extracted

from the eleven interviews.

We used Pi to refer to participant i in the interview.

A. Security Properties

Security experts focus on protecting the conﬁdentiality,
integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of the data managed
by their systems. Table III lists the number of participants
that discussed each of the security properties. We observe
that the participants are concerned about data integrity
and availability but not about data conﬁdentiality. They
are also concerned about secure modiﬁcation, availability,
consistency, accuracy, and misuses of the data over their
life-cycle in their system. For instance, P9 said: "so things
that are important to us are maybe not, as you said, the
conﬁdentiality of it if you’re talking about a control system,
but you’re looking at the integrity of the messaging[...] you
know, the data is the control message." The reason is: data
is used to process the control commands of the physical
components of CPSs. Modiﬁcation and misuses of these
data can cause damages or losses, and unavailability of
data and system components could prevent real-time
feedback behaviors of certain CPSs and cause losses and
damages.

B. Threat Business Impacts

Many CPSs, including connected cars, involve human
as users and are safety-critical systems. Security and
safety are closely related in these systems [20]. The
exploitation of systems’ weaknesses and vulnerabilities
could have a high impact on the safety of the users.
For example, P3 said: "..the cyber threats can actually
impact the physical safety of workers, or you know, cause an
explosion within a plant or any number of potential outcomes".
Besides safety, ﬁnancial losses, and reputation damage are
also important aspects that participants consider when
performing threat modeling of CPSs. Security weaknesses
in the supply chain is a typical example.

C. Threat Modeling Approaches

The participants in the study have either control
systems or IT background. The participants with control
systems background focus on the malicious controllability
of the physical components of the studied system as P11
said "All these methodologies started from this classic [Refer-
ring to ISO27005] as an approach with slight modiﬁcations.
What was added by Evita is the notion of controllability". P1,
for example, uses a ﬁeld-tested custom engine derived
from the ISA/IEC 62443 standard [21] to identify the
physical/cyber threats that apply to each of the assets,
zones (a group of assets), and conduits of the system
under consideration, keeping in mind that a cyber threat
can have a physical attack surface ,and P2 uses the
STRIDE taxonomy [13] and analyze the failure scenarios
that might apply to the components considering the
behavior of the physical components and the safety of
the system. In general, these participants combine the
use of the known approaches such as STRIDE or PASTA
with the analysis of failure modes and criticality of the
physical systems.

Participants with IT background apply the classic
threat modeling approaches such as STRIDE [13] and
DREAD [22]. They identify the assets, the components,
and the data managed by the studied system and
focus mostly on threats to the integrity, availability, and
conﬁdentiality of the data. For example, P5 approach is:
understand the system, identify the weaknesses, identify
potential attacks and mitigations, and prioritize the
identiﬁed threats. They consider that each CPS operates
in a speciﬁc environment, is associated with speciﬁc
weaknesses and type of attacks, which justiﬁes the
use of threats on data rather than misbehavior of the
components of the studied system.

Most of the participants decompose the system being
analyzed into components and analyze the threats to
each of the components. Participant P7 deviates from this
approach and analyze the studied system as a whole.4

4This approach is similar to the approach used to improve business

processes [23].

They look at the weaknesses related to the integration of
the components of the given system.

D. Threat Identiﬁcation Methods

Threat identiﬁcation, a key process in threat modeling,
allows identifying the weaknesses of a given system
that could cause harm and damage when exploited by
attackers. Table IV provides the frequency of using the
common individual threat modeling methods by the
participants. The participants use (1) Known methods,
such as attack-tree and STRIDE, (2) a combination of
known methods, and (3) a combination of security
standards and known approaches.
Known method. Several participants reported that they
use known methods such STRIDE, PASTA [27], LIND-
DUN [26], and attack-tree [24]. Most of the participants
(6 out of 11) use STRIDE. One expert mentioned that they
use the attack-tree method because of its ability to cover
all entry points of the attacks. Hence, they can identify
all possible threats to the system. Some participants
start with a known method and then elaborate further
on their threat model based on their experience and
knowledge. For example, participant P2 identify the
data ﬂow diagram and the physical locations of the
components of the studied system and apply the STRIDE
method to identify the initial list of threats.
Combination of known methods and approaches. Some
participants reported the use of multiple approaches,
such as asset-centric and attacker-centric, in the same
project because they believe that each of the approaches
and methods gives a different perspective of the system
weaknesses and using a set of methods, although time-
consuming, helps to identify the "complete" list of threats
to a given system.
Combination of threat modeling standards and known
approaches. One Participant, P1, uses real-world expe-
rience jointly with the ISA/IEC 62443 standard[21]to
identify the physical/cyber threats that apply to each of
the assets or zones (a group of assets).

model since the changes could modify the attack surface
and introduce new threats to the system.

Some participants do not have processes and/or expe-
rience with managing the evolution of the threat models
of their systems. For instance, one participant reported
that they do not need to have processes for revising threat
models as they are not involved in the businesses of the
systems that they perform threat modeling of and another
participant reported that they do not review the threat
models of their systems even if these systems change. In
addition, Participant P11 reported that the manufacturers
of cars cannot do a correct continuous threat modeling.
They said "..you have two updates per year for the cars...the
information ﬂow concerning various threats is not so good
today because car manufacturers are not aware about all the
threats related to the parts coming from their suppliers."

The rest of the participants (eight from eleven) have
processes or approaches to manage continuous threat
modeling. For example, Participant P1 identiﬁes the
changes or triggers to a system under consideration
and does a thorough threat and vulnerability assess-
ment update, re-assessing the attack surfaces/sources
and the related impacts, and adding new threats and
vulnerabilities if necessary; Participant P5 performs threat
modeling as an activity of their adapted scrum [29]
process; Participant P6 uses version control on source
code of the software to identify changes and periodically
assess in collaboration with the architect the the potential
impacts of the changes on the threat model of the given
system; Participant P7 performs a full threat modeling
of new systems and partial threat modeling when new
components are added to existing systems (only the new
components and impacted components are considered
the partial threat modeling); Participant P8 assesses the
exploitability of the threats of changed systems and
updates the priority of addressing the threats accordingly;
and Participant P9 uses a questionnaire to assess the
impacts of the software changes on the previous ranking
of the threats to the their system. We note that some
participants report that they perform continuous threat
modeling only for formality: to pass their systems to the
next phase of the DevOps [30].

We observe that most of the participants practice
continuous threat modeling, and there is no common
continuous threat modeling approach. This mixed input
shows the importance of continuous threat modeling of
CPS for the industry and the lack of rigorous and efﬁcient
approaches to do so.

F. Risk Assessment Approaches

E. Continuous Threat Modeling Approaches

Developers often modify parts of their CPSs [28] to
introduce new features, ﬁx existing defects, or improve
the maintainability and the performance of these systems.
The evolution of a system often involves changes to its
components, which could invalidate the initial threat

The participants reported the use of several risk anal-
ysis and scoring approaches, which we discuss in the
following.
Using risk standard and/or regulations P1 uses risk
assessment standards ISA/IEC 62443 [21], which provides
guidelines to organize and facilitate a cyber security risk

assessment for industrial automation and control sys-
tems (IACS) while considering the necessary regulations
and sector’s security/risk speciﬁcs, and Participant P7
considers the impacts of the threats on the compliance
with the regulations that their products must adherent
to. For instance, P7 said Regulations play a major role in
telling [..] the stakeholders what’s more important to sustain
the [business], right. I mean, basically, the products [could]
fail [because of] the regulator, and you could be out of the
business."
Known approach. Many of the participants use common
risk assessment approaches, such as FAIR [31] and Bug
Bar [32]. The bug bar method, for example, requires
assessing the criticality and severity of the threats in col-
laboration with the customer (which allows considering
their concerns) and prioritize the threats based on their
severity levels. The FAIR method allows using FAIR data
to analyze and highlight the threats of the threat model.
For instance, Participant P9 said " So we use the fair [...]
threat modeling to highlight the threats and then run that in
fair to actually turn that into a risk."
In-house risk assessment methods. Three participants
have their own risk assessment methods. For instance,
Participant P2 uses a risk register to report the risks of a
given system and continuously monitor these risks, and
Participants P8 uses a custom formula to compute the
risks of a system using the revenue generated by the
system and the criticality of the threats.

G. Quality Assurance Approaches

Most of the participants reported that the quality of
threat modeling exercises depends on the experience and
skills of the experts who perform the threat modeling
and the thoroughness of the assessment, including the
detailed level of the used architecture and profoundness
of the interviews with the stakeholders of the given
system. For instance, P1 said "the ISA/IEC 62443 standard
provides the basic framework but most of the quality of the
assessments is based on real-world experience, which also helps
with the quality of the speciﬁc deviations for every different
sector"

and P11 said "the expert, nothing else." Few partici-
pants use techniques to ensure the quality of their threat
models. For instance, Participant P2 uses peer-evaluation
to assess the quality of the threat models that they create.
They Said " There were certain folks that we would do peer
reviews [of their] threat models.". Participant P3 performs
review at each project milestone to ensure the work done
at the given milestone is of sufﬁcient quality. They said
"at each of the gates or milestones, you do the proper review
to make sure that the work that was done up until that point
is of sufﬁcient quality." And, Participant P6 uses a set of
requirements to verify the coverage of the developed
threat model of the important security aspects related to
the domain of the given system.

H. Roles Involved in Threat Modeling

Table V lists the common roles that the participants
work with when performing threat modeling. Some of the
participants involve the CPS operators, the management
staff, the subject matter experts, and the equipment
suppliers in their threat modeling exercise as they need.
These roles help to gain depth understanding of the
system, including the different environments of running
the given CPS, the operations of the system, the used
equipment, and possibly other aspects. Interviewing
different stockholders helps to develop a "complete"
threat model.

I. Tool

Three participants use Microsoft Threat Modeling
Tool [33] although the tool does not cover the physical
components of CPSs and three participants use their own
tools, including custom templates, for threat modeling.
For instance, P9 said "Microsoft has a threat modeling tool
[...], and there is actually an automotive template that we look
at to plug into our system."

J. Challenges

The participants reported few challenges that they face
when performing threat modeling of CPSs, which we
discuss in the following.
Variety of CPSs. Several of the participants had to work
on threat models of CPSs for several applications domains
(e.g., mining, transportation, smart grid) and use a variety
of physical components that are often not familiar with
at the beginning of the projects. They ﬁnd it impossible
to have broad knowledge about threats for CPSs and
difﬁcult to generalize expertise across CPSs’s application
domains.5 Participants that have IT background ﬁnd
themselves with limited knowledge about the physical
components: they are not familiar with the threats to the
system that they analyze and to the mechanisms that
could be utilized to mitigate the threats to these systems.
Some participants proposed developing a repository of
patterns and mitigation strategies since there are many
threat vectors and attack agents to consider.

Limitation of current threat modeling approaches and
methods. The existing threat modeling approaches, such
as STRIDE and PASTA, focus on computer security. The
use of these methods to perform threat modeling for CPSs
may produce incomplete threat models because these
methods do not cover the physical aspects of CPSs. Some
participants suggest the development of a framework
that allows identifying common practical attack scenarios
based on the application domains of CPSs.
Limitation of tools. Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool is
commonly used to generate an initial list of threats to
a given system based on a default template that uses
the STRIDE taxonomy. It is known that STRIDE focuses
on computer security threats; hence it would produce
incomplete threat models for CPSs.
Challenge in current culture. Current business culture of
"publish now and ﬁx later" has been a challenge for some
participants–sometimes only the threats that are related
to publicly known attacks are considered. To address this
problem, Participant P4 proposes to have the security
experts develop quality threat models that use publicly
available threat patterns. They said: "I think that would be
very useful for the industry at large is a set of threat model
patterns."

V. Discussion

This section summarizes the results of the study and

discusses the impacts of the study and its limitations.

A. Summary

Figure 2 shows the themes extracted from the study
and the relationships among these themes. The ﬁgure
shows that CPSs have security properties requirements
and other associated requirements such as safety. The
goal of the threat modeling processes and the continuous
threat modeling sub-processes is to identify and rank
system weaknesses that violate these requirements. The
participants use several threat modeling methods and

approaches and involve several stakeholders of the CPSs
that they perform threat models of.

According to the participants in our study, integrity and
availability are the security properties the most utmost of
concern for CPSs. In addition, many participants use the
threat modeling method STRIDE, which is unexpected
since the method focuses on the threats to IT systems, not
CPSs. Also, most of the participants use a combination
of known approaches, known methods, and known
standards when performing threat modeling of a CPS.
We note that the participants associate the quality of
threat models mainly to the skills and experience of the
security experts who perform the threat modeling. The
two techniques that some participants use to ensure the
quality of threat models developed by their subordinates
are peer-evaluation and the use of the quality checklist.

B. Impact of the Study

Existing threat taxonomies, such as STRIDE, focus
on either the CIA triad or the controllability of the
physical components of a system. This study reveals that
experts focus on the threats to the integrity, availability,
controllability, and safety of the systems when performing
threat modeling of CPSs. The community should develop
a knowledge repository of practical threats to CPSs
that consider the business impacts of failure of physical
components, including safety besides the CIA triad.

We found that most of the participants use a combina-
tion of known threat modeling approaches, methods, and
standards, which makes threat modeling time consuming–
it is done two or more times. This calls for developing
practical new threat modeling approaches that integrate
both the IT and OT security needs of CPSs effectively.
Such methods should help security practitioners to
produce quality threat models for CPS that could be
trusted by the project managers.

We also observed that the participants use their own
template to tie the risk to the threats of CPSs. Developing
risk assessment methods for CPSs acceptable by the

major actors in the industry will help the experts to
communicate better and exchange information about risks
of CPSs.

In addition, we found that most of the participants do
not use quality assurance methods for the threat models
that they produce. The managers sometimes request
threat models for their CPSs from more than one experts,
especially when the system gets hacked. The community
should explore techniques and standards for assessing
the quality of threat models.

C. Threats to Validity

Initially, we gave an open-source of a CPS to some of
the selected participants and hoped that they provide us
with their threat models, which we could use to study
the practice of threat modeling in depth. The volunteer
participants did not want that given, among others, the
required high time commitment to do so. Therefore, we
opted for exploitative interviews to address our research
questions.

The limitations of the study are classiﬁed into construct
validity, internal validity, conclusion validity, and external
validity are discussed as the following [34], [35].
Construct validity. To address the validity of the relations
between the performed study and the goal of the study,
we performed a literature review, designed an interview
protocol, and tested it with some experts. We collected
information from eleven participants who have different
roles and are located in different cities. This gives
conﬁdence in the stability of the collected data.
Internal validity. To address the validity of the rela-
tionship between the study and its results, we tell the
participants at the beginning of the interviews the goals
of the interview, which should help in ensuring that the
participant and the interviewer share the same goal.
Conclusion validity. To address the validity of the ability
to make correct conclusions from the results of the study,
the main author provided the second author their codes
and the themes for each of the interview, who reviewed
them, to reduce the subjectivity of the results.
External validity. To address the validity of the general-
ization of the study, the eleven participants in the study
are selected to be security experts from nine organizations
in different businesses. We believe the diverse experience
of the participants supports generalizing the results.

VI. Conclusion
This paper reports about the practice of threat modeling
of CPSs. We conclude that (1) ensuring the integrity and
availability of data and system’s components in addition
to controllability and safety of CPSs is the concern of
threat modeling of CPSs, (2) there are differences between
experts with a background in control system and experts
with a background in IT regarding the approaches to
perform threat modeling, (3) the experts use a combi-
nation of known approaches, methods, and standards

to perform threat modeling of a given CPS, (4) most
of the threat modeling participants perform continuous
threat modeling, (5) the experts often use custom risk
scoring methods, (6) most of the participants do not use
quality assurance techniques for the threat models that
they produce and rely depend on the experience and skills
of the expert who performs the threat model, and (7) four
roles are commonly involved in threat modeling, namely
security team, architect, developer, and stakeholder.
