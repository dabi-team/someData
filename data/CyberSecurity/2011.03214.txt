Abstract—With the emergence of smart grids as the primary
means of distribution across wide areas, the importance of
improving its resilience to faults and mishaps is increasing. The
reliability of a distribution system depends upon its tolerance to
attacks and the efﬁciency of restoration after an attack occurs.
This paper proposes a unique approach to the restoration of
smart grids under attack by impostors or due to natural calami-
ties via optimal islanding of the grid with primary generators
and distributed generators(DGs) into sub-grids minimizing the
amount of load shed which needs to be incurred and at the
same time minimizing the number of switching operations via
graph theory. The minimum load which needs to be shed is
computed in the ﬁrst stage followed by selecting the nodes
whose load needs to be shed to achieve such a conﬁguration
and then ﬁnally deriving the sequence of switching operations
required to achieve the conﬁguration. The proposed method is
tested against standard IEEE 37-bus and a 1069-bus grid system
and the minimum load shed along with the sequencing steps to
optimal conﬁguration and time to achieve such a conﬁguration
are presented which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method
when compared to the existing methods in the ﬁeld. Moreover,
the proposed algorithm can be easily modiﬁed to incorporate
any other constraints which might arise due to any operational
conﬁguration of the grid.

I. INTRODUCTION

Smart grids have been emerging readily since their inception
due to their capability of imbibing powers of communication
and computation in electrical grids which leads to better
control and management of the grids. Smart grids being fully
conﬁgurable with respect to their transmission and distribution
have enabled the application of various methodologies to
develop better resilience to attacks or natural disasters [5].
Moreover,
the problem of automatic restoration of smart
grids after an anomalous event has gained importance since
maximum load restoration needs to be done at the earliest to
minimize losses to the economy.

Typically, the reliability of a grid is assured via N-1 or
N-k security criterion but for resilience, various operational
measures need to be employed. Hardening of smart grids is
another step that could be taken to reduce the impact of attacks
on the grid [1]. Grid restoration post-attack is mainly done
by islanding the grid into microgrids which are self-sufﬁcient
through Distributed Generators(DGs) if not connected to the
main grid itself. The reconﬁguration is mainly done through
switches that enable connecting tie lines and opening a
normally closed bus to redistribute the load. Redistribution

enables restoration of maximum possible load by using DGs
in combination with the primary generator or even with other
DGs.

This paper primarily involves a new approach to power
restoration in smart grids post attacks. The objectives are two-
fold. First, the minimum amount of load which needs to be
shed is calculated. Then, the sequence of switching operations
required for achieving such a conﬁguration with minimum
load shed is deduced. For solving the above problems, a graph-
based approach is used where the complete grid is mapped to
a graph with graph nodes as the grid nodes and the edges
as the lines in the grid. In the case of an attack, the graph
is decomposed into several connected components. For the
ﬁrst stage, to ﬁnd the minimum load shed which could be
achieved, all the available tie lines are connected supplying
as much load as possible to the areas blacked out. Once
this conﬁguration is obtained, the second stage is carried out
by identifying the unnecessary tie lines which are connected.
This is identiﬁed by removing the tie lines sequentially and
re-computing the load shed at each of the conﬁgurations
which satisfy the grid criterion. This method is quite efﬁcient
since the order in which the tie lines are disconnected does
not matter which results in a very competitive complexity
once combined with memoization. Once the best conﬁguration
is obtained, a multi-source search is carried out with the
leaf nodes of an island as the sources. The one with the
lowest impact is selected to be shed and the corresponding
sectionalization switches are opened. Moreover, any such line
which causes the radial topology to be disrupted such as
forming a cycle is disconnected.

Finally,

the approach is tested with standard IEEE 37-
node and a 1069 node grid against various attacks and with
various hardening plans. The minimum load shed, the opti-
mum reconﬁguration, and the time to achieve such a result is
noted. Finally, it is compared to the modern state of the art
techniques.

II. RELATED WORK
Smart grid resilience can primarily be enforced by either
hardening the transmission buses through physical measures
[2] or through various operational measures such as reconﬁgu-
ration and DG islanding [3]. Reconﬁguration in power systems
has been particularly helpful since it enables using various
energy sources in harmony and the process reduces load shed
[4]. Moreover, speciﬁc importance can be given to nodes that

 
 
 
 
 
 
are pivotal to the system [6]. Islanding on the other hand
helps mitigate the effects of disasters by clustering the original
network into smaller networks [7]. Several approaches have
been researched to enable restoration of power distribution
during disasters using microgrids and DG islanding such as in
[8], [9].

For resilience against attacks or disasters, hardening serves
as the ﬁrst layer of protection for smart grids. [11] proposed
a greedy algorithm that considers the bus with a maximum
load at each step to develop a corresponding hardening plan.
The Defender Attacker Defender(DAD) model [12] is a widely
used infrastructure for the analysis of smart grids and devising
hardening plans. The DAD model iteratively ﬁnds the optimal
hardening plan for a grid considering reinforced attacks at each
stage. Problems formulated by the DAD model have often been
solved by the Column Constraint Generation(CCG) method
of solving optimization problems [13]. The DAD model was
further modiﬁed to use line switching as restoration measures
[14]. Moreover, the model was further developed to include
certain operational constraints which would account for real-
life limitations [15]. Accounting for DGs, microgrids, etc.
in the DAD model to create a more resilient solution was
ﬁrst experimented with by [16]. [6] proposed a three-stage
hardening and restoration plan based on the DAD model. It
provides an optimal DG islanding strategy and a hardening
plan by iteratively using the results of the previous iteration.
Restoration of power in smart grids is often formulated as
a Distributed System Restoration(DSR) problem which is pri-
marily characterized by optimization problems with complex
objective functions and several topological and operational
constraints. The various techniques employed to solve these
problems include expert systems [17], artiﬁcial intelligence
such as genetic algorithms [18] and fuzzy logic [19], dy-
namic programming [20], various mathematical optimization
techniques [21] and several graph-based heuristic search al-
gorithms [22]. Most of these algorithms do not account for
the inclusion of DGs or microgrids in the computation of the
optimum solution. These factors include various uncertainties
such as bi-directional power ﬂows, islanded conﬁgurations,
etc. These factors have been tackled by [23] which account
for DGs and develop a restoration plan in a two-stage process
specialized for Cold Load Pick Up(CLPU) conditions and in
[24] which used spanning-tree search to develop a restoration
plan considering microgrids inside the primary grid. Resilient
system restoration procedures have also been proposed by [25]
which extends it to the case of natural disasters where several
buses are to be affected at once. For time-critical computations,
an approach based on sequential optimization is proposed in
[28] which provides an approximately accurate solution in a
much shorter time.

Smart grids can be easily modeled in the form of graphs
with the feeders as graph edges between two nodes. [26]
proposed a method of restoration based on minimum spanning
forests. The complete grid is divided into several smaller Self-
Sustained Islanded Grids(SSIGs) which operate in harmony
with each other either through the main turbine or through

DGs. [24] on the other hand represented the grid a spanning
tree and then used selective cyclic interchange policies to
generate a new spanning tree iteratively and selecting the
most optimal one. [27] again used a minimum spanning tree
search to propose a new algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal
conﬁguration accounting for priority information of nodes.
[10] proposes a time-efﬁcient self-healing strategy to connect
the blacked-out sections of the grid to a microgrid with a DG
with a rolling-horizon optimization technique. [29] devises a
power restoration strategy in a radial network with the help of
sectionalization switches based on Edmond’s Maximal Span-
ning Tree Algorithm. [31] proposed a restoration algorithm
based on Dijkstra’s algorithm for computation of shortest paths
and used the results of a stage to reinforce the results of
the next stage. [32] gives another algorithm using Kruskal’s
algorithm. [33] gives an analysis of the various restoration
techniques and compares them on several bases. [35] provides
an algorithm which could ﬁnd all possible solutions to connect
energized healthy zones with blacked-out zones using graph
theory. It then rejects the solutions which do not satisfy all
the constraints. But the algorithm doesn’t account for cases
where a single node from the inactive sub-graph is connected
to multiple nodes from the healthy active sub-graph. Moreover,
it doesn’t account for DGs during load restoration.

III. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY

Our proposed methodology for power restoration in smart
grids can be primarily divided into certain sections. The
problem is deﬁning or choosing a mathematical formulation
based on which we base our further architecture. Then, we
need to devise an algorithm for restoration based on the
constraints of the mathematical formulation. Devising an algo-
rithm involves ﬁnding the minimum load shed possible along
with the optimum switching sequence for reaching a grid
conﬁguration which provides the minimum load shed.

A. Mathematical formulation of constraints

An efﬁcient restoration strategy should account for most of
the topological and operational constraints which might occur
in real-life implementations of the system. In a modern smart
grid, it is assumed that the DGs can operate in harmony with
each other and also with the primary generator. Moreover, each
DG should possess the capability to operate independently
in islanded situations. One of the most widely used models
for the formulation of constraints for solving hardening and
restorations problems is the linearized DistFlow model [30].
It has proved to be quite efﬁcient in the representation of
these kinds of problems as suggested by [13] and [6]. The
constraints according to the linearized DistFlow model can
be formulated as eqs. (1) to (5). Each constraint corresponds
to a limitation of the power grid. More speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst
constraint refers to the power ﬂow balance in the grid. The
second equation corresponds to the actual DistFlow equation
which states that in a closed branch the ﬂow should be limited
whereas in an open branch it should be zero. The bounds for
the amount of load that can be shed at each bus is given by
eq. (3). The generators are constrained by eq. (4). The voltage
constraints at each bus are represented by eq. (5).

For accountability of partitioning of the grid into several
smaller microgrids, several
topological constraints such as
clustering constraints, connectivity constraints, etc. are to
be considered as mentioned in [6]. The above constraints
are simpliﬁed into a sufﬁcient and necessary condition of
radiality according to which a radial graph obeys all the above
constraints [34]. A radial graph is characterized by two major
properties. Each sub-graph of a graph should be connected

and the number of edges should be equal to the number
of sub-graphs subtracted from the number of nodes. It has
been assumed that each controllable DG could form its own
separated island and operate independently to the main grid
or in harmony with it.

B. Graphical Formulation

We have modeled the grid as a connected graph G(V, E)
consisting of the grid feeders represented as graph edges E
and the buses as vertices V . In the normal operational mode,
the tie lines T = {t1, t2...tm} in the grid represented as edges
are not connected, all the sectionalization switches are closed
and the DGs operate together with the main grid if connected.
In the case of a mishap, the tie lines to be closed are identiﬁed
along with the sectionalization switches to be closed. The DGs
in the network could form separate independent islands and
operate autonomously. The radial structure of the graph needs
to be maintained across all situations to satisfy the topological
constraints. The operational constraints are taken into account
while construction of the new graph G(cid:48)(V (cid:48), E(cid:48)). In the ﬁnal
representation, each unsupplied island needs to shed its load,
whereas a supplied island can continue its operation through
a DG or the main generator. The computation required to
ﬁnd this newly computed graph is essentially a combinatorial
problem, but we aim to solve this in polynomial time through
several optimizations in the later sections.

The graph G can be simpliﬁed for processing post-attack by
modeling a connected component CG of the graph as a node
in a new auxiliary graph Ga(Va, Ta). The nodes in Ga would
either have a surplus or a deﬁcit of power supply. The nodes
in Ga which are initially disconnected could be connected by
closing the tie lines T . The tie lines need to be remodeled
for the auxiliary graph by using the mapping for nodes in the
original graph G to the nodes in Ga. The auxiliary graph Ga
can be remodeled back to the graph G for computation of G(cid:48)
by reverse mapping the nodes.

C. Estimation of the minimum load shed

The auxiliary graph Ga is used for computing approxi-
mately the minimum amount of load to be shed. The nodes in
the auxiliary graph are initially isolated but can be connected
by the tie lines T in the smart grid. To estimate the minimum
amount of load shed, we propose to connect all the tie lines
across all the nodes, since this would ensure that the maximum
number of nodes in Ga, hence the maximum nodes in G, is
interconnected. Hence, the graph Ga can be represented in
terms of G as:

Ga(Va, Ta) = G(V, E ∪ T )

(6)

This ensures that the surplus load in certain nodes to be
distributed to the nodes in deﬁcit. In case two nodes in deﬁcit
are connected, it just adds an extra redundant feeder to the grid
with zero power ﬂow. On connecting the tie lines, when two
nodes are connected their combined deﬁcit or surplus power
will be determined by the addition of the two individual power
ﬂow values. This is essentially true since it is consistent with

Fig. 1. A sample grid is shown in (A). The feeders 702-713 and 730-709 are under attack. After the attack, the grid becomes disconnected as shown in (B).
It is divided into 3 connected components, some with a power deﬁcit and others with a surplus. The auxiliary graph Ga is formed in (C) as shown. Since this
is the optimal set of tie lines to be connected, the nodes whose load needs to be shed are searched for as shown in (D). This is the ﬁnal grid conﬁguration
after islanding and reconﬁguration.

the power ﬂow eq. (1) of the linearized DistFlow model used
for the mathematical formulation. It is also powered by the
assumption made above that two DGs or even a DG and
the main generator can work in harmony with each other.
This obtained value for the minimum load shed is used as a
reference for the next stages to obtain an optimal conﬁguration
for achieving this minimum.

D. Obtaining the optimal islanding conﬁguration

The optimal islanding conﬁguration can be obtained us-
ing auxiliary graph Ga constructed in the previous step
and iteratively disconnecting the tie lines which are re-
dundant. For
the maximum number of
tie lines to be disconnected, keeping the minimum load
the tie lines in T . Now,

The process continues until all the tie lines are considered

Note that, we do not consider the conﬁguration where pm <
pm−1, i.e. removing tpm−1 after removing tpm, since the ﬁnal
conﬁguration would be the same as that of the removal of
tpm−1 before tpm. It can be said that the removal of tie lines
is independent of order of removal. This particularly saves a
lot of computations and brings the complexity to polynomial
time.

The complexity of the above algorithm can be easily com-
puted by noting the number of trees formed by the above
process. It can be observed that the number of trees NT (cid:48)
formed by removal of at least tk from Ta could be given by

k

This relation can be used to form a recursive relation on the
total number of trees formed:

m
(cid:88)

k=1

NT (cid:48)

k

= 1(m) + 2(m − 1) + 3(m − 2)... ∼ m3

(11)

This term is of order O(m3) where m is the number of tie
lines in the grid. Moreover, we need to check for the validity of
the constraints for each tree. This would require an additional
O(n) where n is the number of buses. Hence, the overall
complexity of the process is O(m3n).

Finally, the potential conﬁguration with the maximum num-
ber of removals is selected as the optimal conﬁguration Go.
If there is more than one such combination,
then all are
considered as potential solutions. This conﬁguration Go is
further adjusted to recognize the nodes whose load needs to
be shed.

E. Identifying the load shed buses

The conﬁguration Go obtained in the previous needs to
be modiﬁed in order to obey all the operational constraints.
The topological constraints established aren’t violated in the
previous steps. The islands with a power deﬁcit need to shed
some load in order to satisfy the power balance constraints in
eq. (1). Now if the grid has manual control over the individual
buses, it can easily unauthenticated any of the buses it deems
ﬁt to shed load, but this is not often the case. Buses for load
shed are selected from the terminals of each component with
a deﬁcit. Now, each bus might have a weight associated with
it. The impact of load shed on it being represented as :

Pimpact,j = (cid:36)jPshed,j

(12)

We consider a connected component CGo with a power
deﬁcit of the conﬁguration Go and start a multi-source breadth-
ﬁrst search with the terminal nodes as the sources. We iden-
tify the nodes which would lead to minimal overall impact

according to the eq. (12) but could shed enough load so as
to satisfy the power balance eq. (1). The node might belong
to any of the branches but nodes selected in a branch should
be continuous and should originate from the terminals. Once
these nodes are identiﬁed, the sectionalization switches which
need to be opened which can disconnect the selected nodes
from the connected component CGo. For a CGo without a DG
or the main turbine, all the buses in it need to shed their load
in order to satisfy the operational constraints. Moreover, any
such line which causes the radial topology to be disrupted
such as forming a cycle is disconnected. This step introduces
an extra computational complexity of order O(n) but
its
negligible in comparison to the previous term which was of
order O(m3n) Once we perform this for all such connected
components, we have our tie lines to be connected along with
the sectionalization switches to be opened. Hence, we have all
the switching operations which lead to a conﬁguration with
a minimum load shed and a minimum number of switching
operations, and one which satisﬁes all the constraints. A brief
summary of the complete process is given in ﬁg. 1.

Fig. 2. The ﬁgure gives a brief representation of the algorithm presented in
the paper.

Fig. 3. The ﬁgure shows a simpliﬁed representation of the 1069-node grid system. This conﬁguration is used with four taxonomy feeders and interconnected
by seven tie lines. Moreover, DGs are placed randomly in the grid.

IV. EXPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS

The proposed methodology was tested against modiﬁed
versions of the standard IEEE-37 and IEEE-1069 bus test
systems. The reduction in load shed on reconﬁguration and
the reconﬁguration strategy for sample attacks are recorded
and compared with results from currently established systems.
Each system was imported from a GridLAB-D model with
load models of constant power, current and impedance. The
algorithm was implemented and tested on MATLAB and
GridLAB-D on a system with Intel Core i7 8th generation
processor and 16GB RAM.

The modiﬁed IEEE-37 bus system ﬁg. 4 is implemented as
shown in [24] and [25]. Additionally, the system is augmented
with 6 normally open tie lines and 4 DGs at random positions.
All the branches are supported by sectionalization switches.
The performance of the system is compared with the methods
in [24]. The faults were simulated as given in [24] so as to
be able to easily compare our methods. One advantage of our
proposed algorithm is that it works in case of multiple attacks
whereas the one in [24] doesn’t. The simulation results are
presented in table I.

and 709. As a result of this, the buses to the bottom of 709
in ﬁg. 4 are disconnected from the main grid. These could
be connected by joining the tie lines 735-728, 731-725, or
708-718. The best solution to this would be closing the tie
line 708-718. On connecting the line 735-728, we ﬁnd that an
over-current ﬂow through the bus 744 and hence it violates
the power constraints. No load would be shed in this scenario.
In Scenario 3, there are multiple attacks on the lines 730-
709 and 702-713. As a result, the complete grid is divided into
three islands two of which are not connected to any generator.
For load restoration, the tie lines 708-718 and 735-728 are
connected. This leads to overload in the grid and some load
needs to be shed. On computation according to the proposed
methodology, nodes 730, 740, 722, 707, and 724 need to
shed their load. Hence, the switches in lines 720-707, 703-
730, and 711-740 need to be opened. The net load shed was
approximately 2.10 MW.

The R3-12.47-2 1069 bus test system ﬁg. 3 consists of four
taxonomy feeders and numerous tie lines as used by [23] and
[24]. The model provides a good representation of a real-
world populated area. Replicas of a single feeder is made to
construct the four feeder system (Fa, Fb, Fc, Fd) where the

system. The conﬁguration is modiﬁed by introducing tie lines in the existing
grid.

connected by joining the tie lines 713-724, 731-725, or 708-
718. Some sectionalization switches might need to be opened
in case excess load needs to be shed. The best solution to
this would be closing the tie line 713-724. This way no-load
needs to be shed and the normal working of the grid would
be restored in minimum operations.

In Scenario 2, the attack is on the line connecting buses 730

by table III for the IEEE-37 node system. The horizontal axis represents the
number of attacks whereas the vertical axis corresponds to the amount of load

feeders are interconnected with tie switches. Hence, with net
1069 buses, 152 branches with sectionalization switches, and
122,586 possible number of radial topologies, the grid is a
typical representation of an urban grid. Moreover, the grid is
augmented with several DGs to support the primary generators
in case of outrages. The system is similarly simulated against
attacks and reconﬁgured by the algorithm suggested in this
paper and by [23]. The data about the time taken for each
solution is not available in [23] but since it uses MILP which is
NP-Hard it would be much more time-intensive as compared
to our methodology. The simulation results are presented in
table II.

In Scenario 1, the attack was simulated on line 241-159 of
supply feeder Fd. As the result, the part of the grid supplied
by Fd after node 159 was blacked out. For restoration, the tie
line between 252(Fd) to 266(Fc) and 254(Fd) to 248(Fa) was
connected. This leads to overload in certain buses in Fc and
hence switches between nodes 256-254 of Fc and 256-261
of Fd were opened. This restores the load in the minimum
number of operations. The net load shed before islanding was
approximately 3.5MW but it was restored completely.

In Scenario 2, attack was simulated on line 181-182 of
supply feeder Fc. As a result the part of the grid supplied
by Fc after node 181 was blacked out. For restoration, the
tie line between 257(Fd) to 244(Fc), 252(Fd) to 266(Fc) and
236(Fb) to 256(Fc) and 254(Fd) to 248(Fa) were connected.
This leads to overload in certain buses in Fb and violation of
radial topology and hence switches between nodes 256-261
of Fc, 256-77 of Fc and 256-261 of Fd were opened. This
restores the load in a minimum number of operations.

In Scenario 3, multiple attacks were simulated on line 193-
195 of supply feeder Fb and 105-191 of supply feeder Fd. As
a result the part of the grid supplied by Fb after node 195
and the grid supplied by Fd after node 191 was blacked out.
For restoration, the tie line between 75(Fb) to 252(Fc) and

table III for the 1069 node system. The horizontal axis represents the number
of attacks whereas the vertical axis corresponds to the amount of load shed.

254(Fd) to 248(Fa) were connected. This restores the load in
a minimum number of operations. The net load shed was 6.5
MW but was completely restored.

The load shed comparison pre and post-restoration is given
by table III. Graphical representation of the same is given by
ﬁg. 5 and ﬁg. 6. for the IEEE-37 node system and the 1069-
node system respectively.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we present a novel graph-based approach to
the restoration of a distributed smart grid with DGs post-
attack. The method considers all the operational and topo-
logical constraints and provides the minimum load shed along
with the sequence of switching operations to achieve such a
conﬁguration. The method was tested against standard IEEE
grids and other taxonomy grids which prove that it compares
well to the existing methods and provides a result with much
lesser switching operations in much lesser time.

Further improvements may revolve around providing a
resilient hardening strategy based on similar principles which
would enable the system to incur even lower losses in cases
the algorithm could be modiﬁed to
of attacks. Moreover,
account for dynamic changes in grids, isolation of the attack
nodes from the rest of the grid in case it has the potential
to compromise other nodes, etc. Thoughts could be given on
predicting the cost for reconﬁguration before attacks.
