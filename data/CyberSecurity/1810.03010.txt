ABSTRACT

Industry 4.0 envisions a fully automated manufacturing environ-
ment, in which computerized manufacturing equipment—Cyber-
Physical Systems (CPS)—performs all tasks. These machines are
open to a variety of cyber and cyber-physical attacks, including
sabotage. In the manufacturing context, sabotage attacks aim to
damage equipment or degrade a manufactured part’s mechanical
properties. In this paper, we focus on the latter, specifically for
composite materials. Composite material parts are predominantly
used in safety-critical systems, e.g., as load-bearing parts of aircraft.
Further, we distinguish between the methods to compromise var-
ious manufacturing equipment, and the malicious manipulations
that will sabotage a part. As the research literature has numerous
examples of the former, in this paper we assume that the equipment
is already compromised; our discussion is solely on manipulations.
We develop a simulation approach to designing sabotage attacks
against composite material parts. The attack can be optimized by
two criteria, minimizing the “footprint” of manipulations. We simu-
late two optimal attacks against the design of a spar, a load bearing
component of an airplane wing. Our simulation identifies the mini-
mal manipulations needed to degrade its strength to three desired
levels, as well as the resulting failure characteristics. Last but not
least, we outline an approach to identifying sabotaged parts.

1 INTRODUCTION

Industry 4.0 and Factory of the Future movements envision fully
automated manufacturing environments, in which computerized
manufactured equipment– Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)– perform
all tasks. These are vulnerable to a variety of cyber and cyber-
physical attacks, as has been shown for CPS. However, as opposed
to equipment sabotage attacks like Stuxnet [1], manufacturing
sabotage attacks might aim to degrade the mechanical properties
of the manufactured part. This can lead to the destruction of a
system employing such a part. The dr0wned study [2] provides
an experimental proof of these attacks; in the study, researchers
sabotaged a replacement propeller for a quad-copter UAV, leading to
the quad-copter’s destruction after the propeller broke mid-flight.
In this paper we focus on composite materials, which are com-
monly used in safety-critical systems. The aerospace industry was
an early adopter of this innovation, and composite use in aerospace
has increased drastically over time. For instance, the Boeing 787 is
50% composite by weight [3, 4]. The defense industry also favors
composite materials. Composite application areas include aerospace
structures (tails, wings and fuselages), missile components (rocket
motor cases, nozzles, igniters, inter-stage structures), boat construc-
tion, bicycle frames, and racing car bodies (see Figure 1).

Figure 1: Composite Material Market, 2016 (Source: [5])

Most large composite parts are manufactured through automated
processes, instead of the traditional labor-intensive hand-layup pro-
cesses that are still popular for small parts. Incorporating automated
processes like automatic fiber placement, automated tape layup,
filament winding, etc. for manufacturing composites raise secu-
rity concerns. Increased computerization and a key place in the
aerospace and defense industries make composite material manu-
facturing an attractive target for cyber- and cyber-physical attacks.
While we are not aware of any prior publications discussing sabo-
tage attacks on composite material parts, the possibility of sabotage
attacks has already been empirically proven for Additive Manufac-
turing (AM, a.k.a. 3D Printing) with plastics and metals. In AM, it has
been shown that sabotage attacks can degrade a part’s mechanical
strength [6–8] or fatigue life [2].

The contributions of this paper are as follows. We demonstrate
that sabotage attacks on composite material parts are possible,
define two categories of optimal sabotage attacks on composite
material parts, and present a simulation tool developed to calculate
both categories of optimal attacks. We further discuss the properties
of these optimal attacks, and outline approaches that might be used
to identify sabotaged composite material parts.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, based on the
current state of the art, we present the composite material manufac-
turing foundation of our approach. After discussing the considered
threat model and related assumptions in Section 3, in Section 4 we
define both categories of optimal sabotage attacks and outline the
algorithms used to calculate them, for a given part and degradation
requirements. We present and discuss the properties of the achieved
optimal attacks in Section 5. We outline possible approaches to
identify sabotage attacks in Section 6. After discussing sabotage

represents transverse direction for the lamina. The global coordi-
nate system (x-y) is related to the local coordinate system by the
angle (Θ).

In Appendix A we have summarized the well-established equa-
tions commonly used to calculate the mechanical properties of
CFRP.

2.2 Computer Aided Manufacturing of

Composite Material

The composites industry is moving from hand layup to automated
processes. Automated Tape Layup (ATL) and Automated Fiber Place-
ment (AFP) are the current automated additive manufacturing
techniques for composites in the industry. ATL and AFP are per-
formed by Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines with
programmable axis movement, axis drives, and a printing head.
They place laminated tapes and tow layer by layer to produce a
specific part.

2.2.1 Automated Tape Layup. ATL can be considered an Addi-
tive Manufacturing process used to produce large simple composite
structures. ATL can lay prepared tape and continuous fabric strips
ranging from 75 to 300 mm wide onto a flat surface in different
orientations [9–11]. ATL heads are comprised of spools of tape,
a winder, winder guides, a compaction roller, a tape cutter, and a
position sensor. ATL composite production starts by depositing a
prepared tape onto a mold using a silicone roller. Subsequent layers
are deposited according to CNC paths defining the part geometry.
Once the layup is completed, the tape is cut automatically by ro-
tating or pinching blades. The speed of machine layup depends on
the complexity of the part. There is a reported 70-85% reduction in
man hours in the aerospace industry due to the implementation of
ATL techniques [12].

2.2.2 Automated Fiber Placement. The AFP process places bands
of material consisting of 2-32 individual tows or slit tape using
low tension and compaction pressure [13]. The tows are usually
1/8” to 1/4” wide. These tows can be laid at their own speed and
start/stop along the length of the band at the desired locations. The
use of robots allows the AFP process to be highly controllable and
repeatable. For fabrication, creel systems are loaded with tows of
composite tape. During band placement, individual tows are fed and

attacks identified for AM in Section 7, we conclude this paper with
a brief overview of the presented work and conclusions from it.

2 BACKGROUND

In this section, we provide background material for composite mate-
rials and their manufacturing relevant to this paper. In Appendix A
we summarize a mathematical method that is well-established in
materials science for the calculation of a composite material’s me-
chanical properties.

2.1 Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)

Composite materials are the combination of two or more materials
with different sets of properties. The composite benefits from the
best properties of each of the combined materials or achieves a
new set of properties which are unique and cannot be achieved in
either of the individual materials. Despite their high cost, composite
materials have gained popularity in high performance products that
need to be lightweight but able to bear large loads.

This paper primarily considers Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer
(CFRP), a composite that is very popular in the aerospace and
automotive industries because of its high strength-to-weight ratio.
CFRP derives its strength from sheets of carbon fiber that are bound
together with a polymer-like epoxy. Individual sheets of carbon
fiber are referred to as lamina or plies, and the complete composite
as a laminate (see Figure 2).

Each individual carbon fiber lamina shows strong anisotropic
properties, i.e., mechanical characteristics like strength and stiffness
are different in different directions. To control this anisotropy, lami-
nas are placed in the laminate at different angles. Figure 3 shows the
local and global axes of an angle lamina. Vectors 1 and 2 represent
the local coordinate axes whereas x and y are the global coordinate
axes. Vector 1 lies along the fiber length direction, which represents

the system pass in front of a heat source (laser, hot gas torched) and
under the consolidation device. The heat melts the tape, causing it
to stick to the substrate when pressed down by the consolidation
device. Once a band is placed, the tows are cut and the robot head
returns to place the next band. The process repeats band-by-band,
until a ply is complete, and then ply-by-ply until the final part is
produced.

2.3 Quality Assurance

Optical systems are being integrated by most manufacturers for in-
line quality control during the AFP process [10]. Fiber orientation is
an important parameter to monitor during manufacturing; sudden
changes in fiber orientation indicate defects such as gaps, overlaps,
twisted tows and contamination with foil. The strength and stiff-
ness of the composite laminate greatly depends on the orientation
sequence of the plies. Axial load is taken by 0◦ plies, shear load
by ±45◦ plies and transverse load by 90◦ plies. Fiber orientation is
therefore a major criterion for quality assurance (QA).

The optical system, Automated Ply Inspection (API), was devel-
oped by Flightware for NASA’s two AFP machines. It consists of
a sensor mounted in the AFP head [14]. A laser line is projected
on the layup surface. A commercial laser line scanner acquires the
optical measurement of the layup surface in a two-dimensional
profile, usually comprised of 1000-1500 discrete points. Automated
scanning generates a very accurate and dense point cloud that in-
cludes the minute details of the layup surface. The position of the
sensor in space at any instant is known so 2D data points from the
sensor could be converted into 3D coordinates in the part coordi-
nate system. Thus, lines of data points can be obtained hundreds of
times per second. Layup features of interest such as overlaps, edges,
gaps, splices, orientation etc. are embedded in the point cloud data
and layup surface points are plotted in 3D space. Comparing the
actual ply edge location to an expected ply edge location defined on
the part coordinate system helps determine the laydown accuracy
of the machine. The whole process is automated by the Flightware
software called Feature Detection.

3 THREAT MODEL & FOCUS OF THE PAPER

While we are not aware of any prior research on composite materi-
als security, composite manufacturing is quite similar to Additive
Manufacturing (AM), a.k.a. 3D Printing. For attacks on or with
AM, one should distinguish between attack vectors, compromised
elements, manipulations, and effects [15]. A variety of attack vectors
can be used to compromise one or more elements of the manu-
facturing process. The compromised element(s), their roles in the
process, and the degree to which an adversary can control these el-
ement(s) determine which manipulations an adversary can perform.
These manipulations, in conjunction with the type of manufactur-
ing process, manufacturing equipment, source materials, and object
application area, determine the achievable effects. Only a fraction
of the achievable effects intersect with the adversary’s goals. The
intersection of attack effects and adversarial goals are attack targets
(or threats). We consider these points valid for composite materials
manufacturing.

3

For AM, two major security threats identified in the research
literature are intellectual property theft [16–20] and sabotage at-
tacks [2, 6–8]. These threats are also present in composite materials.
In this paper, we focus explicitly on the latter threat category. Fur-
thermore, in the manufacturing context, sabotage attacks aim to
degrade a manufactured object’s material properties, damage man-
ufacturing equipment, or damage/contaminate the environment of
either the manufactured part or the manufacturing equipment [15].
This paper focuses solely on sabotage attacks aiming to degrade a
manufactured part’s mechanical properties.

Numerous real-world as well as academic attacks have proven
that a broad variety of classical cyber attack vectors can be used
to compromise computerized elements of a manufacturing pro-
cess. The most prominent real-world example remains the Stuxnet
attack [1], which has compromised both SCADA computers and
manufacturing equipment firmware (a uranium enrichment cen-
trifuge).

Examples from the closely related AM security literature (we
provide a more detailed description in Section 7) are also numerous.
Considering attack vectors, researchers have complained about
the lack of the security features associated with design files or de-
sign file transfer [21], identified that the employed software and
firmware have numerous vulnerabilities [22], exploited weaknesses
in the communication protocol to highjack the session [23], or used
social engineering to convince a user to open a malicious e-mail
attachment [2]. Compromised elements include computers that
store design files and control the manufacturing process [2, 6], com-
munication networks that connect these computers with the robo-
tized manufacturing equipment [23], the firmware installed on the
equipment [24, 25], or even an in-situ quality control system [26].
These compromised elements can stage a variety of manipulations,
including tampering of the design files [2, 6], manufacturing pa-
rameters [7, 8, 25], manufacturing process status information [26],
and altering communication timings or power supply [27, 28].

The fundamental difference between AM and composite materi-
als security lies in the parameters that determine the mechanical
properties of the manufactured part. This also determines which
malicious manipulations are available to an adversary to sabotage
a part’s quality.

Based on the prior discussion, we consider the following threat

model:

• Supported by prior work, we assume that one of the com-
puterized elements in the manufacturing process is com-
promised. It can be a PC that stores design files and controls
the overall manufacturing process, a computer network
that connects this PC and the roboticized ATL or AFP ma-
chine, or the firmware on this machine.

• In this paper, we focus on distinct manipulations that are
characteristic to all composite material parts–the orienta-
tion of individual plies in a laminate. This can be performed,
e.g., by modification of the design files on a compromised
computer. Other malicious manipulations like changing the
temperature-profile during the curing process are possible,
but are out of scope for this paper.

• Functional parts are typically designed with extreme tol-
erable operational conditions in mind. We assume that an

adversary knows this and can discern the operational con-
ditions based on the design alone. Furthermore, we assume
that the adversarial goals can be tied to the (discernible)
operational conditions.

• Last but not least, the example of the–supposedly state-
actor staged–Stuxnet sabotage attack also shows that ad-
versaries will go to great lengths for attack stealthiness
while still achieving their goals. We therefore assume that
an adversary will be willing to minimize the malicious ma-
nipulations (in the case considered in this paper, changes of
the individual ply orientations) while still achieving their
stated goal (in the considered case, reducing the mechan-
ical properties to the level below discernible operational
conditions).

4 OPTIMAL SABOTAGE ATTACKS

The mechanical properties of a composite material directly depend
on several factors. The most important are the number of plies, the
material of individual plies, the orientations of individual plies, the
presence of defects like gaps or overlaps, and bonding between plies.
This paper alters only ply orientation, holding all other parameters
constant.

For part degradation sabotage attacks achieved through ply orien-
tation, we define two categories of optimization criteria: (i) minimal
amount of orientation deviation (∆Θ) for all plies, and (ii) minimal
number of plies whose orientation is changed. We consider attacks
that satisfy these criteria as optimal, because they minimize the
“footprint” of the attack while achieving the specified degradation
characteristics.

Based on the mathematical foundation described in Appendix A,
we developed a MATLAB program that takes as input an unaltered
composite material design (i.e., a sequence of plies, including their
material and orientation) and calculates both optimal attacks. The
simulation program consists of three functions, described in more
detail in this section.

The first calculates a strength ratio for each ply in a laminate; it
also determines the sequence in which the layers will fail as well as
the corresponding forces. The remaining two functions use the first
as a sub-routine and calculate two categories of optimal sabotage
attacks using defined optimization strategies.

4.1 Helper Function: Calculate Max Force and

Ply Failure Sequence

Please note that all equations referenced in this section are described
in Appendix A; these equations are well established in materials
science.

The flowchart in Figure 4 summarizes an algorithm that is used as
a core component in the calculation of both attack types described in
this section. This function is based on the algorithm for the Strength
Ratio (SR) calculation as described in Ramsaroop et al. [29]; our
modifications are indicated with a darker (sea blue) background.

The algorithm takes as its inputs the material properties, the
details of the laminates, a vector of resultant forces, and moments
indicating how the forces are distributed. The output of the algo-
rithm is an array of SR for all plies and the sequence of forces at
which plies fail.

Figure 4: Calculate Max Force and Ply Failure Sequence

We start with the input values of the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s
ratio, shear modulus (E1, E2, ν12, G12), and number of layers. We
use these values to calculate elements of the reduced stiffness ma-
trix [Q] according to the Equation 6. This matrix and the array of
the orientation (Θ) are then used to calculate the array of trans-
posed reduced stiffness matrices [Q] for each ply; the calculation is
performed according to the Equations 8 and 7.

We use the information about layer thickness and the number
of layers to calculate the Z coordinates of mid- and end-planes for
each ply (see Figure 2). The sign convention used here is positive

the middle layer as reference.

We then use the previously computed transposed reduced stiff-
ness matrix [Q] and the coordinates of end-planes to calculate the
extensional stiffness matrix [A], coupling stiffness matrix [B], and
bending stiffness matrix [D] according to Equations 12, 13, and 14,
respectively. These matrices, the resultant forces N , and resultant
moments M are then used to calculate mid-plane strains ϵ 0 and
curvatures k according to Equation 10.

All prior calculated values are used to determine the global and
local stresses and strains. For the calculation of global strains Equa-
tion 11 is used. We use Equation 5 to calculate global stresses. To
calculate local strain and stress, Equation 9 is used, which relies on
the values of the global strain and stress.

The components of Tsai-Wu failure theory are calculated us-
ing Equations 16 through 18; for this, the ultimate tensile stresses
(σT
)ul t , and the ul-
timate shear stress (τ12)ul t are used. The Tsai-Wu parameters to-
gether with the previously determined local stress are then used to
calculate the laminate’s SR values, one per ply.

Up till this point, the described calculations are derived from
the approach layout in [29]. The remaining calculations have been
introduced in order to accommodate the specific needs of our algo-
rithms which determine optimal attacks.

After the SR values are calculated, the array is searched to find
the plies with the lowest SR value. These are the plies which fail
first. These plies fail at the force equal to the product of their SR
value and the resultant forces N and moments M. We remove these
plies from the further considerations by setting their transposed
reduced stiffness matrix [Q] equal to [0].

If not all transposed reduced stiffness matrices [Q] have been set
to [0], this indicates that at least one ply has not failed yet and can
withstand the applied force. In this case, we re-enter the algorithm
at the stage when the extensional stiffness [A], coupling stiffness
[B], and bending stiffness matrices [D] are calculated. Otherwise,
all plies have failed and we can exit the algorithm.

During the algorithm, the following output values are calculated
and updated when necessary. The “Critical Force” is implemented
as an array of forces under which one or more plies will fail. With
every element of the array, a list of plies is associated that will fail
under this force.

4.2 Optimal Attack, Type One: Minimal

Changes per Individual Ply

The algorithm for the first attack type (see Figure 5) requires the
specification of the original laminate (layer thickness, ply orienta-
tion angles, and the number of layers), properties of the materials
in the laminate (Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ration, etc.), and the re-
sultant forces. Further, the algorithm takes into account two safety
factors (SF). The first SF specifies the ratio by which the original
composite design exceeds the expected operational conditions. The
target SF describes the desired degradation of composite’s mechan-
ical properties as a ratio of the expected operational conditions.

In the algorithm, based on the specifications of the original de-
sign, we calculate the critical force that this design can withstand.

Figure 5: Computation of Type 1 Optimal Sabotage Attack

This force together with both strength ratios is then used to calcu-
late the target critical force, the force under which the sabotaged
composite should fail.

We then enter a loop over all of the plies. For each iteration,
the algorithm uses two pointers to “Current Plies.” These are plies
that undergo modifications of their orientation. We initialize these
pointers to one or two middle plies (depending on the total amount
of plies used in the laminate). Then, we check whether these plies
are critical force bearing or not. If they are, we rotate the plies.
If the specified ply angle is negative, rotation is going to be in
the negative direction; otherwise, we rotate the ply in the positive

After rotation, the critical force is recalculated, using the
helper function described in Section 4.1 (see Figure 4) and the two
pointers to current plies are either incremented or decremented, so
that they traverse outwards. If the considered plies are not critical
force bearing, only the pointers are updated.

If, after the rotation of the current plies, the critical force still
exceeds the target and the end of the laminate is not yet reached, we
repeat the rotation process for the new current plies. If the target
force is reached, the algorithm returns the updated orientation of
all plies.

4.3 Optimal Attack, Type Two: Minimizing

Amount of Tampered Plies

The algorithm for the second attack type (see Figure 6) takes the
same parameters as the first. It also performs the same initial calcu-
lations to determine the critical and target forces. The current ply
initialization is also identical.

Starting with the current plies, the algorithm first tries to find
the next critical force bearing plies, traversing the sequence of plies
from the center outwards. If the algorithm can’t find a critical force
bearing ply, this means that no solution could be found.

Whenever a critical force bearing ply is found, the algorithm
begins rotating it. If a 1 degree positive rotation results in a higher
critical force, a 1 degree negative rotation is tried. Whichever ro-
tation direction resulted in a lower critical force is repeated until
it begins increasing again, indicating a local minimum. If the crit-
ical force is still above the target at this point, the next critical
force bearing ply is located and undergoes the same rotation pro-
cess. On reaching the target, the algorithm outputs the updated ply
orientations.

5 SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

To analyze a realistic scenario, we use the composite design of a
wing’s spar proposed in [30] for a small scale 20 seater WIG (Wing-
in-Ground Effect) vehicle. The composite consists of 34 layers of
Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite material. In
all our calculations we assumed a graphite fiber/epoxy composite
(a.k.a. carbon fiber/epoxy). The material properties for graphite
fiber/epoxy composite are summarized in Table 1 [31]. For each ply
in the composite material, an angle is specified. While the rotation
alters the ply’s mechanical properties in various directions, all plies
combined provide the mechanical properties required for the spar.
In our experimental evaluation, we have assumed that the me-
chanical properties were designed with an SF of 1.5. This is a com-
mon approach in the aerospace industry, in order to accommodate
for rare extreme conditions during operation as well as for uncer-
tainties in the manufacturing process, including possible impurities
of the source materials or deviation in the manufacturing process
like curing parameters.

In our simulation, we have used the specification of the compos-
ite design and the assumed SF to calculate the forces that the wing’s
spar should bear during normal operational conditions. Forces and
moments should be proportional to the assumed critical forces and
moments that will be applied to the wing structure. For the consid-
ered spar we use the vector of resultant forces N = (1, 0, 0) N /m
and resultant moments M = (0, 0, 0) N /m.

In order to evaluate several attack scenarios, we have simulated
attacks that will reduce the SF to three different values: 1.0, 0.9, and
0.8. For both attack types and the three targeted SF, we calculated
the necessary changes of the ply orientation. Table 2 summarizes
the results of our simulation. It also provides a quick reference for
the angle deviation between the altered and the original designs. At
the bottom of the table we summarize the maximum angle deviation
in both the positive and the negative directions. For each simulated
attack, we also provide a number of plies whose orientation was
altered or remained unaltered.

As defined in Section 4, a Type 1 attack attempts to achieve the
specified mechanical properties degradation while minimizing the
angle deviation between the tampered and the original ply orienta-
tion. For all considered degradation factors, the deviations are in
range between −12◦ and 15◦. Because of the optimization criteria,
most plies’ orientation must be altered. These angles of deviation
can be eventually detected during a manual layer inspection; the
number of plies affected increase the probability of detection even
if not all plies are inspected.

A Type 2 attack is optimized to minimize the number of lay-
ers that are altered. For the considered scenario and safety factor
degradation, up to 16 layers must be altered in the extreme case.
However, this optimization will require a large change in the ori-
entation angle, up to 43 degrees. These angles of deviation can
be easily detected during the manual inspection. However, if only
some layers are inspected, the attack may remain undetected.

Figure 7 depict how the attacks alter the critical forces at which
plies fail. The original design was optimized to have first ply failure
at the applied force of 2166 N /m in the x direction. At this force,
only four plies fail. The next failure would occur at a force of 2628
N /m in the x direction and lead to the failure of an additional eight
layers. Both of these failures occur well before the entire laminate
will fail at a force of 4125 N /m in the x direction. This behavior is
characteristic of composite part design and is known as progressive
failure. The considered design is obviously optimized for safety,
even in the event of a first ply failure that can be noticed by pilots
or maintenance crews on the ground.

The simulated attacks have fairly different ply failure behavior.

failure occurs. For all considered scenarios the force is under 1500
N /m in the x direction. Significantly more critical is the follow-up
behavior of the sabotaged composite. The force increment for the
follow-up failure is negligibly small, and it leads to a cascading
failure of the remaining plies. Such behavior of a bad composite
design is known as catastrophic failure. This can obviously lead to
catastrophic consequences, such as the crash of an airplane due to
the broken spar.

6 IDENTIFICATION OF SABOTAGED PARTS

A Ground Vibration Test (GVT) is a non-destructive test commonly
performed in aircraft manufacturing. During GVT, data is obtained
that can be used to model the flexible dynamics of the tested aircraft.
An input force is applied to the aircraft via an electrodynamic
shaker. The resulting excitation is measured by accelerometers
at multiple points across the aircraft. These excitation points are
chosen far away from spar to include both bending and torsion.
The measured force and acceleration data obtained is further post
processed to determine the modal frequencies and mode shapes
using Quadrature Response Method and Curve-Fitting Frequency
Domain Decomposition (CFDD) [32].

The performed sabotage attacks will change the laminate prop-
erties, including its stiffness (see Table 3). The effective orthotropic
modulus E can be calculated using the following equation:

For isotropic material, the modulus of elasticity has an impact

relationship is given by the following equation [33]:

Where m is the mass, b is the width, L is the length, t is the
thickness of the sample, and T is the correction factor depend on
Poisson’s ratio and dimensions of the sample. Since the sabotage
attacks considered in this paper only alter the laminas’ orientation,
keeping all remaining parameters constant, the fundamental reso-
nance frequency is directly proportional to the square root of the
modulus of elasticity:

Based on this relation, we can calculate the ratio of fundamental
resonance frequency change between the original and sabotaged
designs (f /f ′). As frequency is one of parameters to measure and
analyzed during GVT, its significant changes can be used to detect
sabotaged parts. Table 3 summarizes the impact of the sabotage
attacks considered in this paper on this ratio.

For the first category of sabotage attack and reduction of a safety
factor from 1.5 to 1.0 and 0.9, the frequency change is around 10%.
For the second category of sabotage attack, the frequency change
is significantly lower, and can be as little as 4%. However, taking
into account measurement errors and deviations during benign
manufacturing process, it is uncertain whether such slight changes
of frequency can be (i) detected, and (ii) attributed to a sabotage
attack. Nevertheless, we see changes of fundamental resonance
frequency as an important characteristic that could be used to
identify sabotaged parts.

7 RELATED WORK

To the best of our knowledge, there are no peer-reviewed publica-
tions focusing directly on security of composite materials. There is,
however, a growing body of literature in a related field, the security
of Additive Manufacturing (AM). The identified threat categories
for AM include Intellectual Property (IP) violation, manufacturing
of legally prohibited objects, and sabotage attacks on manufac-
tured functional parts or manufacturing equipment [28]. For this
paper, only sabotage attacks and related literature are of relevance.
It should be noted that, by the end of 2017, no publications have
addressed security of composite materials [34].

Several publications have analyzed 3D printers and the 3D print-
ing processes for vulnerabilities. Turner et al., 2015 [21] found
that networking and communication systems lack integrity checks

contamination of its environment.

Several publications present methods for detecting sabotage
attacks. Chhetri et al., 2016 [35] used the acoustic side-channel
inherent to the FDM process to detect tampering with a 3D printed
object; the authors report that the detection rate of object modifica-
tions is 77.45%. Belikovetsky et al., 2018 [36] also rely on acoustic
emanations of a FDM 3D printer. Authors define five categories of
atomic modifications at a single G-code command level, and identify
the detectability thresholds for each category. The defined cate-
gories are (a) insertion of a command, (b) deletion of a command,
(c) modification of movement length on the axis, (d) modification
of extruder speed, and (e) re-ordering of G-code commands. Strum
et al., 2017 [37] proposed an impedance-based monitoring method.
The authors physically coupled a piezoceramic (PZT) sensor to the
part being fabricated and measure the electrical impedance of the
PZT. These impedance measurements can be directly linked to the
mechanical impedance of the part, assisting in detecting in-situ
defects of part mass and stiffness. Two further papers built upon
the cross-domain attack notion introduced in Yampolskiy et al.,
2013 [38], and propose a notion of cross-domain attack detection.
Chhetri et al., 2017 [39] demonstrated the flow of information be-
tween the cyber and physical domains and how this information
can be used for performing cross-domain security analysis. By esti-
mating this relationship, the model can be used for the detection of
new cross-domain attack models and attack detection techniques.
Wu et al., 2017 [40] leverage machine learning methods to detect
cyber-attacks in the manufacturing process. The authors have used
vision and acoustics as the data sources for machine learning algo-
rithms and were able to detect anomalies with high accuracy (96.1%
and 91.1% respectively).

8 CONCLUSION

Composite materials often offer better mechanical properties at
lesser weight, as compared to conventional materials. They are pop-
ular in the aerospace, high-end automotive, and defense industries.
Due to the excellent mechanical properties and ability to optimize
these for expected operational conditions, composite materials are
frequently used as functional parts in safety-critical systems, in-
cluding parts of an airplane’s wings or fuselage. In order to ensure
the quality of composite materials under persistent security threats,
it is paramount to understand the properties of potential sabotage
attacks.

In this paper, we focused on sabotage attacks that degrade me-
chanical properties by changing the orientation of individual plies
of composite material. We left all other manufacturing parameters
unaltered. For this category of sabotage attacks, we have defined
two categories of optimal (or minimally invasive) sabotage attacks
that degrade mechanical properties to the desired level: (i) mini-
mal amount of deviation from the original ply orientation, and (ii)
minimal number of plies whose orientation is changed.

For the identification of both sabotage attack categories we have
developed a MATLAB simulation program that takes as input a
sequence of plies, including their material and orientation, and
desired degradation; the output of this program, for each attack

and on Fundamental Resonance Frequency

when receiving the design files. Moore et al., 2016 [22] identified
numerous vulnerabilities in software, firmware, and communica-
tion protocol commonly used in desktop 3D printers; these can
be potentially be exploited. Do et al., 2016 [23] have shown that
communication protocols employed by desktop 3D printers can be
exploited, enabling the retrieval of current and previously printed
3D models, halting an active printing job, or submitting a new
one. Belikovetsky et al., 2017 [2] used a phishing attack to install a
backdoor that enabled arbitrary, targeted manipulations of design
files by a remote adversary. Sturm et al., 2014 [6] used malware
pre-installed on a computer to automate the manipulation of STL
files. Moore et al., 2016 [25] used malicious firmware to modify and
substitute a printed 3D model.

A growing body of publications discusses how a manufactured
part’s quality can be compromised. The majority focus on Fused
Deposition Modeling (FDM), commonly used in desktop 3D printers.
Sturm et al., 2014 [6] demonstrated that a part’s tensile strength can
be degraded by introducing defects such as voids (internal cavities).
Zeltmann et al., 2016 [8] showed that similar results can be achieved
by printing part of the structure with the contaminated material.
Belikovetsky et al, 2017 [2] proposed degrading a part’s fatigue life;
the authors argue that the defect’s size, geometry, and location are
factors in the degradation. Yampolskiy et al, 2015 [7] argued that the
anisotropy intrinsic to 3D printed parts can be misused to degrade
a part’s quality, if an object is printed in the wrong orientation.
Zeltmann et al., 2016 [8] have experimentally shown the impact
of this attack on a part’s tensile strength, using 90 and 45 degree
rotations of the printed model. Chhetri et al., 2016 [35] introduced a
skew along one of the build axes as an attack. Moore et al., 2016 [25]
modified the amount of extruded source material to compromise
the printed object’s geometry. Yampolskiy et al. [28], based on
the prior joint work with Pope et al., 2016 [27], identified that
indirect manipulations like the modification of network command
timing and energy supply interruptions can be potential means of
sabotaging a part. Yampolskiy et al, 2015 [7] discussed various metal
AM process parameters whose manipulation can sabotage a part’s
quality; for the powder bed fusion (PBF) process, the identified
parameters include heat source energy, scanning strategy, layer
thickness, source material properties like powder size and form, etc.
Yampolskiy et al., 2016 [15] argued that in the case of metal AM,
manipulations of manufacturing parameters can not only sabotage

specified degradation of mechanical properties.

We have applied the developed program to the wing spar of
a small-scale 20 seater airplane. Assuming a safety factor (SF ) as
1.5 and desired degraded properties at 1.0, 0.9, and 0.8 of expected
operational conditions, we calculated that the necessary deviations
can be astonishingly small. For the first category of attacks, it is
sufficient to change orientation of all plies by as little as 11 degrees,
13 degrees, or 15 degrees for SF = 1.0, SF = 0.9, and SF = 0.8
scenarios. For the second category of attack, it is sufficient to modify
the orientation of 16 plies, with maximal deviation of 33 degrees,
34 degrees, and 43 degrees for SF = 1.0, SF = 0.9, and SF = 0.8
scenarios.

While from the cyber perspective it sounds like a significant
difference, the ability to detect such attacks is not guaranteed. First
of all, many manufacturers still employ manual quality control. If
every layer is controlled, especially for the first category of attack,
deviations can be small enough to evade detection by human qual-
ity control team. If CNC machines like Automated Fiber Placement
(AFP) and Automated Tape Layup (ATL) are used, a cyber-attack
that changes the design file will both degrade the mechanical prop-
erties and compromise the quality control measures.

Especially critical is the catastrophic failure characteristic of the
sabotaged composite. After the first ply failure, the force increment
for the follow-up failure is negligibly small, and it leads to almost
immediate destruction of all remaining plies. This undermines a
critical characteristic of composite material design, progressive
failure. Such rapid failure could easily lead to disasters, such as
airplanes crashing from a failed wing spar.

A CALCULATING MECHANICAL

PROPERTIES: HOOKE’S LAW FOR A
TWO-DIMENSIONAL ANGLE LAMINA

Figure 3 shows the local and global axes of an angle lamina. 1-2
represents the local coordinate axes whereas x-y represents the
global coordinate axes. 1 lies along the fiber length direction, which
represents longitudinal direction. 2 is normal to the fiber length
and represents transverse direction for the lamina. Together they
represent the principal material directions in the plane of the lamina.
Axis 3, which is transverse to both the fiber axis and the plane of
the lamina, is not shown in the figure as the lamina is considered
two dimensional. The global coordinate system (x-y) is related to
the local coordinate system by the angle (Θ).

Laminas have low strength and stiffness in the transverse direc-
tion. So, angled laminas are placed in the laminate to overcome
these properties. Fiber reinforced composites are inhomogeneous
and non-isotropic (orthotropic) in nature; therefore, Hooke’s law
(σ = Eϵ) cannot be applied directly. The stress-strain equations for
orthotropic lamina in both the local and global coordinate systems
are given by Equations 4 and 5, respectively [31].

The [A], [B], and [D] matrices in the Equation 10 are called
extensional stiffness matrix, coupling stiffness matrix, and bending
stiffness matrix for the laminate, respectively. The Equations 12
through 14 can be used to calculate these matrices.

Where n is the number of lamina; [(Qi j )]k is the i-th, j-th element
of the matrix [Q] for the k-th layer; i, j = 1, 2, 3; hk is the distance
from the laminate midplane to the bottom of the k-th lamina. The
sign convention used for hk is positive below the mid-plane and
negative above the mid-plane (see Figure 2).

Among the various failure theories applied to composite struc-
tures, Tsai-Wu failure theory is considered more general and closely
correlated with the experimental data [4]. According to this fail-
ure theory, the lamina is considered to be failed if Equation 15 is
violated.

(τ12)ul t is the ultimate shear stress in 1-2 plane.

Strength Ratio (SR) is defined as

SR = Maximum Load which Can be Applied

Load Applied

(19)

When SR > 1, the lamina is safe and the applied stress can be
increased. If SR <= 1, the lamina is unsafe and the applied stress
needs to be reduced. For example, SR value of 1.8 means that loading
can be increased up to 80% without failure. The concept of SR is
applied to any failure theory. For the better use of this theory each
stress component in Equation 15 was multiplied by SR and resulted
an Equation 20 [29].
