Abstract 

The increase in popularity of connected features in intelligent transportation systems, has led to a greater risk 
of cyber-attacks and subsequently, requires a more robust validation of cybersecurity in vehicle design. This 
article explores three such cyber-attacks and the weaknesses in the connected networks. A review is carried 
out on current vulnerabilities and key considerations for future vehicle design and validation are highlighted. 
This  article  addresses  the  vehicle  manufacture’s  desire  to  add  unnecessary  remote  connections  without 
appropriate security analysis and assessment of the risks involved. The modern vehicle is “All Connected” and 
only as strong as its weakest link. 

Keywords: Connected Vehicles, Cybersecurity, Connectivity, Hacking, Safety 

Introduction 

The growth of connected features in intelligent transport systems  has been proportional to the increase of 
automotive  cyber-attacks  in  recent  years  [1].    The  first  consumer  connected  vehicle  was  manufactured  by 
General Motors  Cadillac in 1996  [2].  The connectivity feature, known  as  the OnStar system,  consisted of an 
emergency  messaging  service  which  contacted  authorities  with  the  GPS  location  when  the  airbags  were 
deployed, such as at the time of a collision. However, in the event of the system being exploited, a hacker could 
leverage available data to track the car and trigger fake emergency response calls from the vehicle. In the 
following years OnStar was enhanced further and by 2003 it was able to perform vehicle health reports and 
turn-by-turn  directions  through  a  connection  to  the  vehicle  framework  and  an  external  secure  network, 
respectively. When this data is exposed to hackers, user location and other personal data is accessible along 
with the route plan of the vehicle. Fortunately, these systems are still functionally secure with regards to road 
safety  of  the  vehicle  as  the  connected  system  only  comprised  of  advisory  messages  and  navigation 
instructions. More involved control-by-wire systems such as Tesla’s Autopilot [3] in 2014 were released to the 
public, presenting a greater risk of cyber-attacks affecting road safety. 

Vehicle designers are integrating more and more connected features into their products with a view to 
providing enhanced safety and user experience for their customers [4] leading to an increase in the number 
of  access  points  which  require  robust  cybersecurity  features.  This  paper  describes  three  case  studies  of 
cyber-attacks in recent years and how they were handled. It will then explore the evolution of cybersecurity 
technology and how these attacks may have been prevented.  

Case Studies 

The need for enhanced cybersecurity increases as more connected features are integrated into vehicles. In 
2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
first published a public warning on the dangers of connected vehicles and the risk of security systems being 
penetrated  by  an  outsider  [5].  The  following  sections  will  discuss  security  system  failures  of  connected 
vehicles from a variety of manufacturers.

Jeep, Cherokee – 2015 

Garrad and Gilroy: Developments in Connected 
Vehicles and the Requirement for Increased 
Cybersecurity 

A 2015 Jeep Cherokee was hacked by Miller and Valasek [6], two cybersecurity experts. Previously, the duo 
had exploited open cyber-attack vectors by hacking a Ford Escape through the OBD-II (On Board Diagnostics) 
connection.  However,  this  time  the  hacking  was  performed  remotely  over  15  kilometres  away  through  the 
internet connection on the vehicle. The Uconnect feature was exploited, which allowed access to the vehicle’s 
infotainment  system  remotely.  The  feature  contained  a  vulnerability  that  allowed  the  IP  address  to  be 
accessible to the hacker. The hackers then gained access to drive by wire systems and were able to toggle 
the ignition, lower the engine speed, abruptly engage brakes or disable the brakes.  They were also able to 
access  the  Jeep’s  GPS  and  IMUs  (Inertial  Movement  Units)  to  measure  its  speed,  distance,  direction. 
Additionally, the Uconnect feature allowed them to control the heating and radio systems. Once a vehicle’s IP 
address is exposed, the vehicle can be hacked anywhere, anytime. 

Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) – 2016 

PenTestPartners  exploited  a  2016  Mitsubishi  Outlander  PHEV  [7].  Many  new  cars  use  a  Global  System  for 
Mobile Communications (GSM) module so the owner may communicate with the vehicle when away from it to 
track its location, set the heating, open windows etc. The 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV model uses a Wi-Fi 
access  point  instead  of  a  GSM  module  for  connected  services.  This  greatly  limits  the  range  the  user  can 
remotely access their vehicle and leaves it more susceptible to attacks by using a less  common method of 
remote connection. PenTestPartners took advantage of this vulnerability [7],  by cracking the Wi-Fi Pre-Shared 
Key  (PSK),  and  then  only  required  access  the  vehicle  while  it  was  connected  to  an  authorised  phone.  This 
provides access to disable the alarm and even unlock the car. Once they knew a vehicle’s SSID (Service Set 
Identifier) any vehicle of the same make and model could be found and connected to a mobile device in order 
to determine its geolocation. 

Nissan Leaf – 2016 

A similar attack occurred with a 2016 Nissan Leaf in the same year [8]. In this case, Nissan’s “NissanConnect” 
software required the user to enter the vehicle identification number (VIN) into an app to connect to the vehicle. 
In  many  cases  the  VIN  was  stamped  on  the  windscreen  for  easy  access.    As  the  VIN  is  composed  of  the 
manufacturer code, model code and country code, cybercriminals only needed approximately 5 digits to vary 
between vehicles. This connection can be established remotely and once connected a hacker can determine 
the vehicle’s geolocation and control all heating and cooling units (air, seat, steering wheel). 

Other Recent Cyber-Attacks  

Further research of case studies in recent years has made note of hacks primarily involving eavesdropping of 
sensitive data and GPS coordinates [9]. In 2018 three of BMW’s models were proven to have vulnerabilities 
through OBD connection allowing the hacker to shut off the vehicle by overloading the system with erroneous 
messages [10]. In 2017 a Tesla fleet was hacked by exploiting a bug in the fleet’s central sever. The hacker 
gained access to control any car in the fleet, being able to pass Tesla commands, such as drive home remotely 
[11]. Other cyber-attacks on Tesla in 2018 involved communication jamming by sending  noisy messages over 
the local network [9]. 

Context Information Security exposed vulnerabilities in the 2020 Ford Focus and Volkswagen Polo [12]. 
Weaknesses were discovered in the infotainment system of the 2020 Volkswagen Polo which when exploited 
granted  a  hacker  access  to  toggle  the  traction  control  and  review  personal  data  of  the  driver.  Context 
Information Security was also used to perform a “man in the middle” attack on the Ford Focus, intercepting 
messages from the TPMS (Tyre Pressure Monitoring System). When presented with the technical report Ford 
choose to ignore it whereas Volkswagen choose to implement countermeasures.

Challenges and Countermeasures 

Garrad and Gilroy: Developments in Connected 
Vehicles and the Requirement for Increased 
Cybersecurity 

• 

This section outlines the main challenges faced by the vehicle manufacturers and how they can be addressed: 
The Automotive Industry faces similar challenges to the Software Industry but with higher stakes: Due 
to the complexity and redundancy  required to implement  a  connected vehicle, the average modern 
high-end car has 100 million lines of code [13]. Facebook, which consists of 51 million lines of code and 
has 108 listed vulnerabilities in the National Vulnerability Database in the past 3 years [14]. Facebook 
has also been publicly hacked once so far in 2021 and on three occasions in 2019, exposing confidential 
information of close to 1.5 billion users [15], [16], [17]. This demonstrates that modern software is also 
challenging to design with sufficient attention to security.  

•  Security is an afterthought, or a patch: Bug fixing is a common approach to handling software flaws 
found in software. When it comes to cyber vulnerabilities, considering the cyber security risks at the 
design phase is a prerequisite to developing a connected vehicle [18].  

•  Supply chains which requires thorough validation: In vehicle manufacturing and assembly, there is a 
long  line  of  suppliers  for  each  component.  Cybersecurity  must  be  considered  during  component 
integration  involving  a  knowledge  share  between  suppliers  [18].  A  study  showed  less  than  40%  of 
original  equipment  manufacturers  and  suppliers  are  aware  of  knowledge  sharing  for  component 
integration taking place [19].   

•  Lack of sufficient stress testing: There are insufficient professional white coat hackers. More than half 
of the cyber-attacks are performed by cyber criminals rather than researchers  [20]. To reduce the 
risk of vehicles being hacked in the field more extensive real world ethical hacking should be done 
during design and test phases. 

Types of Attacks 

As more connected features are integrated to vehicles, there is a higher risk of vulnerabilities [21]. Connected 
vehicles  are  vulnerable  to  two  modes  of  cyber-attacks,  active  and  passive.  An  active  attack  is  when 
communications are disrupted or replaced by falsified messages, a passive attack is where data is collected 
over a longer time [22]. These attack modes consist of multiple attack types. The attack-type is determined by 
the method used to carry out the hack. Active attacks include spoofing, dysfunctional sensor processing, side 
channel attacks. Passive attacks include man-in-the-middle attacks. Active attacks are more dangerous but 
fortunately easier to detect as the functionality of the vehicle becomes compromised [22]. Passive attacks do 
not change or interact with the functions of a vehicle, merely listen to the communications. 

Communication layer 

A hacker can gain access to a vehicle through several ways. External communications such as V2X (Vehicle-
to-Everything) and infotainment systems are entry points for hackers. Internal access points are OBD-II and 
USB ports. However, once the hacker has gained access to any of these access points, they may be able to 
connect to the various internal communications [23]. Figure 1 below shows the common attack types, attack 
vectors and attack surfaces that are exploited by hackers [21].

Garrad and Gilroy: Developments in Connected 
Vehicles and the Requirement for Increased 
Cybersecurity 

Figure 1: Overview of cyber-attack types, attack vectors and attack surfaces [21] 

Attack Surfaces 

Each function has its own network protocol based on its requirement [24]. For example, the Media Oriented 
Systems  Transport  (MOST)  bus  systems  are  used  for  media  and  infotainment  around  the  vehicle  and  it  is 
typically  not  connect  to  any  of  critical  systems.  Controller  Area  Network  (CAN)  connects  the  powertrain 
sensors, hybrid drive, transmission and engine controller. It checks the data at each node to verify it is secure 
and related to that node, if not it skips it. If exposed the CAN bus is far more valuable to a hacker. The attack 
surface varies as detailed below: 

•  GPS:  GPS  can  be  spoofed  by  a  hacker  sending  misleading  messages  to  the  connected  vehicle. 
Alternatively, the GPS can be hacked using a signal jammer. A signal jammer sends a strong signal 
repeatedly to prevent the valid signal to be received [25].  

•  Key/Ignition:  The  key  has  always  been  the  prime  means  of  accessing  a  vehicle.  Key  fob  hacks  as 
mentioned in  the  case  studies in section 2, and  with electronic key  fob cloning  [26]  this remains a 
concern. 

•  Media System: The media system commonly refers to infotainment and telematics. Infotainment is an 
umbrella term for in-car information and entertainment. Some of this information is text messages, 
notifications etc. received from connecting to a mobile phone. It also includes streaming music and 
videos  from  a  mobile  device.  Telematics  refers  to  internal  vehicular  data  such  as  fuel  efficiency, 
vehicle  speed,  climate  control,  direction,  odometer,  among  others.  Infotainment  and  Telematics 
systems  are  vulnerable  to  attacks  by  malware  which  can  be  installed  through  the  owner’s  phone. 
Countermeasures to prevent these attacks include using source code obfuscation to make it harder 
for the hacker to create malware [27]. 
TPMS: Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems have a built-in sensor on the wheel which connects to the 
vehicle using a short-range signal such as Bluetooth [28].  

• 

•  LiDAR: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a key sensor used for perception and localisation of 
connected vehicles with a high level of automation. As it uses laser light for detection, it can be hacked 
externally by using strong lights to imitate or hide objects [29].  

•  Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Hotspot: These are exploited in similar ways as they require the hacker to be in 
close range with the vehicle to  connect to the system.  With successful  connection to these  attack 
surfaces a hacker can typically access the Media System. 

•  OBD-Port: OBD-II monitors control and engine systems and can send an error to the vehicle user if a

sensor fails. It is used for vehicle diagnostics and is in all vehicles since 1996 in the US and Ireland. 
This port can be hacked by installing malware through direct connection. Alternatively, a dongle can 
be used and the OBD-II may be hacked remotely. Monitoring the frame injection to the OBD-II is a way 
to  prevent  this.  Also,  signing  and  encrypting  of  firmware  updates  should  be  carried  out  by  the 
manufacturer [24].  

•  ECU: ECU’s (Electronic Control Units) are connected to the vehicle’s CAN network, passing data from 
the drivetrain and a range of other sensors. The ECUs are typically not connected to a remote network 
however by passing an erroneous signal through peripheral sensors these too can be exploited [30]. 
•  Cameras:  On  connected  vehicles,  cameras  are  used  to  monitor  the  vehicle  environment.  With 
automated functions such as ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) camera data is processed 
to control the vehicle and guide it. Cameras can be hacked by passing fake data [29].  

Case Study Countermeasures 

Once vulnerabilities are identified by vehicle manufacturers, security measures can be taken. In the case of 
the Jeep, Cherokee – 2015, Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.4 million cars and supplied a secure update to prevent this 
attack from re-occurring in the future [6]. For the Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) 
– 2016 the vehicle manufacturer updated the  firmware for the Wi-Fi module to implement a stronger PSK, 
blocking future occurrences of this cyber-attack, allowing users to reenable the app [7]. For the remainder of 
that vehicle model Mitsubishi continued to use the Wi-Fi Module over the more secure GSM module for cost 
purposes but swapped to the GSM Module in 2019 with the newer model. An alternative solution for this issue 
is to disconnect and unpair all mobile devices from the vehicle the Wi-Fi modules essentially goes to sleep. 
Lastly, the Nissan Leaf – 2016 hack resulted in Nissan disabling “ConnectEV”, while an updated version was 
developed [8]. 

Conclusions 

The  rise  in  uptake  in  connected  functions  in  modern  vehicles  has  led  to  increase  in  the  number  of  cyber-
attacks committed in recent years. Connected vehicle technology will continue to progress with the rise of 
automated and autonomous vehicles. In order to maintain safety and security while increasing the number of 
connected vehicle  functions the automotive  industry,  academia and government  bodies need to  be aligned, 
especially in terms of safety standards.  As technology advances, safety standards and regulations should be 
reviewed and updated as appropriate.  

From  the  case  studies  outlined,  it  is  evident  that  further  validation  and  oversight  is  required  in  the 
development  cycle  of  connected  vehicle  functions.  The  cases  studies  and  corresponding  countermeasures 
discussed provide examples of vulnerabilities that were discovered only after public release of the vehicles. 
Each of the weaknesses could have been discovered and corrected in the development cycle of the vehicle 
with  thorough  penetration  testing.  It  is  important  that  vehicle  manufacturers  continue  to  learn  from  these 
novel cybersecurity trends. There are many connected systems such as “Uconnect” and “ConnectEV” that do 
not  directly  benefit  the  vehicle’s  functionality  and  could  be  removed  to  balance  resources  and  focus 
cybersecurity on key areas, such as drive-by-wire systems more efficiently. It  is important  for  automotive 
manufacturers to remember that the “All Connected” vehicle is only as strong as its weakest link.
