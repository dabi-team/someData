Highlights 

•  A systematic review of the last ten years of research on security culture, information 

security culture and cyber security culture   

•  Top management support, security policy, awareness/training key to building cyber security 

culture 

•  Developing a security culture requires in-depth knowledge of organisation and employees 
•  Questionnaires and surveys often used to measure culture, but have several weaknesses 

which should not be overlooked 

•  Very few cyber security culture frameworks/approaches have been evaluated in the real-

world 

Abstract 
While the creation of a strong security culture has been researched and discussed for decades, it 
continues to elude many businesses. Part of the challenge faced is distilling pertinent, recent 
academic findings and research into useful guidance. In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by 
conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture research. This work 
investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are 
essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a 
security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA 
systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 
years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that while there have been notable changes in the use 
of terms (e.g., information security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential 
factors across papers are similar. Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness 
for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed 
revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting 
appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to 
measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures 
are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and 
management of a robust security culture. For research, we produce an up-to-date characterisation 
of the field and also define open issues deserving of further attention such as the role of change 
management processes and national culture in an enterprise’s cyber security culture. 

Keywords: Cybersecurity culture, information security culture, security awareness, organisational 
culture, management, business, SMEs, behaviour, psychology.

1.  Introduction 
Over the last decade, the topic of security culture has featured heavily in practice and research as 
organisations look to combat an increase in attacks that exploit human factors. Within this domain, 
several terms have been used including security culture, information security culture and more 
recently, cyber security culture. Although cyber security is often used synonymously with 
information security more generally, the nature of the two terms arguably differs. For example, Von 
Solms and Van Niekerk (2013) define cyber security as the aim to protect an additional set of assets, 
particularly human and organisational assets, which can be regarded as more extensive. It therefore 
may be seen to consider shared values, beliefs and expected behaviours regarding the protection of 
this wide set of aspects (Ioannou et al., 2019; Da Veiga, 2016a). 

In this paper, we contribute to the practitioner and academic communities by critically investigating 
the state-of-the-art of cyber security culture research through a systematic review of ten years of 
related literature. This work seeks to summarise key research developments within an area that still 
proves challenging for businesses in their pursuit of building robust security cultures 
(ComputerWeekly, 2019; Tripwire, 2020). Specifically, we apply a rigorous systematic review 
process with the aim of examining how the use of terminology has changed, the factors central to 
building a cyber security culture, and the frameworks and tools used to cultivate and measure it. 
This research is novel as compared to other related security culture reviews (e.g., Glaspie & 
Karwowski, 2017; Nasir et al., 2019a; Sas et al., 2020) through its combined coverage and analysis of 
these three areas (instead of disparate studies), meta-analysis of pertinent, recent research (to 
understand the origins and context of articles published and provide more general insight into the 
direction of the field), and identification of current outstanding issues as we enter a new decade. 
We also differentiate our work from other articles focused specifically on security policy compliance 
(e.g., Bulgurcu, Cavusoglu & Benbasat, 2010; Moody, Siponen & Pahnila, 2018; Cram, D’arcy & 
Proudfoot, 2019; Paananen, Lapke & Siponen, 2020) as this study aims to be wider in scope, with 
policies and compliance discussions primarily considered through articles that examine security 
culture. This is a similar approach to existing culture studies (Nasir et al., 2019a; da Veiga et al., 
2020), and is beneficial as it guides our scope and contributions. 

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines and explains the PRISMA 
protocol used to conduct the review. In Section 3, the results of the article selection process are 
presented as well as a review of the articles – both their details and contributions as it pertains to 
our research aim. Next, Section 4 engages in an in-depth analysis of the results discovered, reflects 
on open issues in security culture research, outlines practical implications, and considers our 
findings in the context of related prior reviews. Section 5 concludes the article and summarises our 
insights for research and practice. 

2.  Methodology 
2.1 Protocol and registration 
The present research used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 
(PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al. 2009). PRISMA outlines a robust protocol which has 
demonstrated use in security research (Knight and Nurse, 2020). Such systematic review techniques 
use carefully designed methods to select and review relevant research literature and analyse the 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

results that emerge from the research. The aim is to synthesise understanding using a valid and 
reliable technique (Okoli and Schabram, 2010). Our work draws on PRISMA’s checklist, as well as a 
four-phase flow diagram, to help guide the analysis. The checklist defines the main sections and 
topics that need to be presented and addressed in the review, while the flow diagram includes 
protocols related to identification of sources and articles, screening of articles, determining 
eligibility, and inclusion of relevant articles.  

2.2 Eligibility criteria 
This systematic review used the following eligibility criteria to help decide which research articles 
were relevant. This inclusion criteria (IC) included:  

• 
• 

• 

IC1, which required only articles published in English.  
IC2, if IC1 was met, involved articles pertaining to and extensively covering the broader 
topic of cyber security culture (inclusive of related terms such as security culture and 
information security culture).  
IC3, if the article had met the first two criteria, included articles that were specific to 
organisations; i.e. organisations in general or users in organisations, often employees. This 
allowed our research to exclude articles that concentrated on national or the public’s 
security culture.  

2.3 Information sources 
The search was applied to ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus 
and ProQuest libraries. ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and Web of Science cover 
the widest body of research on computer science and more specifically cyber security. Scopus and 
ProQuest were useful databases in capturing research articles from non-computing domains. These 
additional libraries helped increase the chances that all relevant articles were considered; 
organisational culture, for instance, touches on a wider scope of topics such as psychology and 
business management. The choice of these six article repositories and publisher databases was 
preferred as compared to other options (such as Google Scholar, for instance), due to the higher 
chances of finding relevant, peer-reviewed articles. Our search was run in August 2020 and covered 
articles published from January 2010 to August 2020. This period would capture the most recent 
research as well as allowing us to consider the emergence of cyber security culture as compared to 
more dated terms including information/IT security culture. 

2.4 Study selection 
Using the four phases outlined in the PRISMA diagram, the study selection process followed these 
steps: 

1.  Electronic databases were searched, focusing on literature that pertained to cyber security 
in organisations. The keyword query was designed to use terms that related to the topic of 
interest and would allow the widest capture of articles. Specifically, the following search 
was used across the databases: (“security culture” OR “cybersecurity culture”). 

2.  Duplicates both within and across databases were then removed following the collection of 
results. The title, abstract and keyword listing of each research article was reviewed, and 
articles were filtered manually and marked as appropriate if inclusion criteria were met. If 
not, the relevant criteria were noted to record exclusion reason. 

3.  The remaining articles that were not excluded in step 2 were either partially or completely 

reviewed and further refined based on the inclusion criteria. Once the relevant articles were 

3 

 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

determined, these were further narrowed down to only include articles from 2010 and 
onwards, limiting the review period to the last 10 years. 

4.  Reference lists of relevant literature were scanned to include any studies that may have 
been missed. These were subject to the same actions in steps 2 and 3, and added if the 
inclusion criteria and the publication year requirement was met. 

These actions were performed and reviewed amongst authors. This allowed any disparities to be 
discussed and agreed. 

2.5 Data items collected 
The review focused on extracting data from articles that were associated with examining how the 
use of security culture terminology has changed, the factors central to building a cyber security 
culture, and the frameworks and tools used to cultivate and measure it. These are further detailed 
in Table 1.

3. Results 
3.1 Study selection 
In total, 58 research articles fulfilled the criteria outlined and thus were selected for review. The 
keyword search across the databases resulted in 1931 articles. From these, 536 were removed as 
they were duplicates. Following this, the first inclusion criteria (IC1) was applied, and 30 articles 
were discarded. After assessing the title, abstracts and keywords of the remaining articles, 1110 
articles were excluded as they did not meet the criteria (IC2) of referring to cyber security culture

(which, as discussed in Section 1, we view as inclusive of information security culture). The full text 
of the remaining 255 articles were reviewed against the final criteria (IC3), and a further 200 results 
did not meet the criteria and thus were excluded. Three additional articles fit the criteria but were 
excluded because we were unable to access the full text. The reference lists of the final 52 articles 
were examined, and after checking the inclusion criteria, a further 6 papers were added to the final 
set. Figure 1 illustrates a PRISMA flow diagram outlining the process used to achieve the final 58 
articles.

Paper distribution. Six out of 58 articles (~11%) were published in 2010, one in 2011 (~2%), and 
four in 2012 (~7%). No articles were included from 2013. Eight out of 58 (~14%) were published in 
2014, and the highest number of articles included were from 2015 at ten (~17%). Five articles (~8%) 
were included from 2016, four from 2017 (7%), five from 2018 (~8%) and eight from 2019 (~14%). 
At the time of our search in August 2020, seven articles (~12%) were included for review. 

Publication type. Figure 2 displays a simplified visual of the number of studies and their publication 
type (journal or conference) in each year. Of the 58 articles, 32 papers were published at 
conferences, and 26 published in journals.

Publication venue. Table 3 was created to summarise the number of papers by source of 
publication venue. A range of journals and conferences, including Computers & Security, Pacific Asia 
Conference on Information Systems (PACIS), Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information 
Technology (JATIT), International Symposium on Human Aspects of Information Security and 
Assurance (HAISA), International Information Security for South Africa Conference, Information 
Management & Computer Security, and Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), had 
two or more articles within this review. The two most frequently appearing journals, Computers & 
Security, and Information and Computer Security, publish research in the field of security. 
Computers & Security issue articles aimed at IT security professionals to provide expertise and 
practical advice on management of systems. Information and Computer Security focuses on 
organisational and business domains of information security. The ethos of both journals is 
consistent with culture research and is likely the reason for the high total of published papers from 
this review.

Author distribution. Figure 3 represents the geographical distribution of the author(s); where 
authors are affiliated with different countries, all locations have been represented. 22 studies were 
carried out by authors located in South Africa, over a third of the research in this review. From 
reviewing the data, it is clear that there are certain prolific researchers in that country that have 
found ways to work with organisations and industry to push forward security culture research and 
practice. The remainder of the authors are located across Asia-Pacific, Europe, North and South 
America and the Middle East. It is worth noting the relatively low number of articles from the US (3) 
and Europe (e.g., UK, France, Spain, Portugal and Norway have a total of 12) who are typically 
significant contributors to cyber security research.

Participants. Across the studies, most articles that incorporated employee participation used a 
range of participants from top management to employees. One article solely included business 
owners and managers (P42). Looking particularly at IT employees, eight articles included IT 
specialists, experts or information security managers as participants (P1; P8; P17; P20; P21; P44) or 
their departments (P10; P50). Two articles involved Human Resource (HR) managers (P4; P27). 

Sector or industry of focus. There was no sector or industry predominant across the review. Where 
mentioned, case studies within papers included a wide variety of organisations such as 
manufacturing, higher education institutions (HEIs), and finance and insurance firms. Concentrating 
on industries, there were three articles focused solely on the healthcare industry (P9; P32; P37), 
two on banking and finance (P4; P45), one on retail (P26), and six on public organisations, i.e., 
governments and HEIs (P4; P21; P23; P36; P40; P46). The other selected papers did not concentrate 
on a specific industry.  

Security culture domain. Security culture domain explores the differing terms surrounding cyber 
security culture and their respective applications. Figure 4 displays the proportion of articles that 
exclusively discuss security culture, information security culture or cyber security culture. The 
majority examine information security culture (42 in total), in comparison to only ten studies that 
consider cyber security culture. Seven studies analyse security culture, with no direct reference to 
information or cyber security. Cyber security culture articles have increased in the last 5 years, with 
a rise in articles in 2019. Where a study reflects on multiple domains, the paper has been 
represented in all appropriate categories.

Figure 4. Distribution of articles that discuss each security culture term and the year of publication 

A majority of the articles state a definition of cyber security culture by which their research aligns 
within the study. Additionally, not all studies aim to provide a method in which security culture can 
be measured or assessed. Most articles do present a framework or approach in which a security 
culture can be built and maintained. A majority (42 papers) focus on developing frameworks and 
tools, and analysing approaches to build an information security culture. A total of ten articles (P9; 
P11; P15; P22; P23; P29; P31; P34; P47, P58) present either multiple variables, or present findings 
focusing on one factor that influences cyber security culture. When exploring cultural metrics, 32 
articles include a measuring instrument or tool to assess security culture. However, only three 
articles are focused primarily on defining security culture within their work. These points are 
discussed in detail in the next section.  

3.3 Definitions and characteristics of cyber security culture 
In total, five of the articles reviewed (P14; P35; P52; P54; P58) were predominantly focused on 
defining, characterising, or conceptualising cyber security culture (all-encompassing information 
security culture and security culture). To present these, this work focuses on definitions of 
information security culture, security culture and cyber security culture emerging from the 
research.  

Most of the papers (49 studies) had a general definition of security culture or described its 
characteristics. Although not included in this review due to their publication date, two early 
definitions of information security culture appear to have guided definitions throughout the last ten 
years. The first definition by Dhillon (1999), described it as, “the totality of human attributes such as 
behaviours, attitudes and values that contribute to the protection of all kinds of information in a 
given organisation”, supporting the idea that human characteristics play a part in information 
security culture. The second definition by Martins and Eloff (2002), regards it as an “assumption 
about perceptions and attitudes that are accepted in order to incorporate information security 
characteristics as the way in which things are done in an organisation, with the aim of protecting

information assets”, which further alludes to the role employee behaviour plays in the safeguarding 
of data.  

Exploring information security culture definitions further, values appeared in 20 papers, such as 
P17, P20, and P42. Protection also features in 14 papers; e.g., P5, P33, P54. The attitudes of 
employees were referred to by 13 papers, including P10, P11 and P27. Assumptions appeared in the 
definitions of 13 papers, for example P9, P35 and P58. Within 12 papers, beliefs surrounding the 
characterisation of information security culture are mentioned, such as P15, P23, P34. The 
perception of employees and their behaviour appeared in eight papers, including P21, P38, and P54.  

It is notable that only seven papers (P7; P14; P30; P36; P44; P45; P48) specifically define cyber 
security culture. Some cyber security culture definitions are similar to information security culture 
definitions, such as those featured by P44 and P46. Ioannou et al. (P44) describes cyber security 
culture as, “procedures laid down by an organization to all its employees, directing their course of 
action in all situations related to data integrity” and Nasir et al. (2019b) (P46) defines information 
security culture as emphasising, “the security of information assets by improving employees’ 
information security behavior”. Both suggest encouraging improved employee security behaviour 
particularly in relation to data/information.  

In other cases, however, cyber security culture definitions tend to be broader in scope, and are less 
specific to the protection of information. Da Veiga (2016a) (P30), for example, characterised cyber 
security culture as something that, “promotes or inhibits the safety, security, privacy, and civil 
liberties of individuals, organizations or governments”, which covers wider ground than solely the 
security of data, but also includes keeping people and organisations secure in their entirety. The 
same applies to the definition provided by Alshaikh (2020) (P52) who characterised cyber security 
culture as “contextualized to the behavior of humans in an organizational context to protect 
information processed by the organization through compliance with the information security policy 
and an understanding of how to implement requirements in a cautious and attentive manner as 
embedded through regular communication, awareness, training and education initiatives”. 

Astakhova (2014) (P14) posits that information security culture and cyber security culture are not 
synonymous. This is because the core of information security culture is its protection of security and 
data/information. However, the two concepts are intertwined and can be seen as separate parts of 
a whole.  

Several studies reviewed include a definition with a specific focus on organisations. Eight papers 
(P2; P8; P43; P47; P49; P52; P54; P58) incorporate organisational culture within the definition of 
security culture. P8, P47 and P58 describe security culture as a subculture of organisational culture. 
The latter characterise information security culture as encompassing socio-cultural measures such 
that information security becomes a natural part of an employee’s daily activities. Mokwetli and 
Zuva (2018) (P42) characterise the concept as interrelating with corporate systems and procedures. 
These definitions all call attention to the organisational foundation that cyber security culture needs 
to be built upon. 

Another common theme in security culture definitions is security awareness, often viewed as an 
aspect of security culture (P3; P47; P54). Security awareness is described as the conditions in which 
users within an organisation are both committed to and aware of the security mission (Siponen, 
2000). The interaction between security awareness and security culture appears often in 
information security research and these factors will be picked up on in the next section.

3.4 Cyber security culture factors  
Overall, ten papers (P9; P11; P15; P22; P23; P29; P31; P34; P47; P58) explicitly studied the factors, 
or a particular factor, deemed as critical to building or maintaining a good, or positive, security 
culture. Others included factors within their discussions. Table 5 displays the most frequently 
occurring and pertinent factors appearing in the literature, and the related studies for further 
reference. We also include general definitions and descriptions for each factor listed in the 
Appendix; this assists in explaining how these terms are used.

The most discussed factor, particularly in terms of maintaining a positive security culture, is the 
support and leadership from top management. Thirty-four studies mentioned the importance of 
management, or leadership expectations to ensure security culture is at the forefront of an 
organisation and its culture. Notable examples of such studies include P1, P8, P12, P14, P23, P27, 
P38, P47, P54 and P57. For instance, Masrek et al. (2017) (P38) includes management support as a 
factor which is subdivided into two dimensions; information security importance and information 
security commitment, exemplifying the need for full support and involvement from top 
management. 

A further 27 studies highlighted the importance of having clear policies and procedures for 
employees to understand and abide by. P27, P31, P37, P38, P44, and P47 are examples of papers 
that demonstrate the need for clear and well-communicated policy. Employee understanding often 
relates to policies and procedures; knowledge of these requirements is a vital part of both building 
and maintaining security culture, which is mentioned by 11 studies such as P7, P10, P12, P37 and 
P51. Security awareness and training programs are often studied together in research. A total of 24 
studies (including P1; P38; P46; P54) in some way consider security awareness and its effect on 
security culture, and 21 studies (such as P1; P22; P27; P50) highlight that training is essential to 
increase security awareness and thus to cultivate culture. Wiley et al. (2020) (P58) studied the 
relationship between information security awareness and training; their findings support a positive 
relationship between both security training and security awareness, and also security awareness 
and security culture. These findings generally give evidence to support the often-assumed link 
between these two concepts. 

One of the more intriguing factors, mentioned by 12 studies, is the management of change. 
AlHogail and Mirza (2014b) (P13) discussed that although many studies propose factors important 
to security culture, few have mentioned the transition process towards cultivating information 
security culture within an organisation. Arguably, previous studies have not provided concrete 
advice as to how to make changes if security culture is not at the positive level needed to protect 
information and systems. Change management is seen by Nel and Drevin (2019) (P47) and Van’t 
Wout (2019) (P51) as a critical factor for inciting actual change needed to build and maintain 
security culture.   

Along with understanding policies and procedures, compliance is a key aspect for employees in 
ensuring the values of an organisation are maintained; a total of 12 studies include compliance as a 
factor that influences security culture. For instance, P10, P17, P38, and P54 all discuss employees 
actioning and complying with policies. Compliance here focused on the process of ensuring 
employees and the organisation as a whole adheres to standards and regulations on security. Other 
highly discussed factors are accountability and responsibility (P12; P20; P23; P34; P38; P45), and 
user behaviour or management (P17; P19; P24; P25; P29; P30). Reid and Van Niekerk (2014) (P19) 
introduce the role of the user, dividing this concept into the nature of the task, the behaviour of the 
user and the psychology of the user. As these factors are frequently mentioned across multiple 
papers, this demonstrates the importance of employee responsibility to their behaviour within an 
organisation. This also lines up with the definitions of security culture covered in Section 3.3.

Commitment appears in eight papers (P1; P15; P17; P23; P37; P38; P43; P46) and generally pertains 
to the activities needed to ensure ‘buy in’ to allow policies to be adhered to and a strong culture 
fostered. It is apparent that trust, acknowledged by six papers (P7; P25; P30; P39; P47), is also seen 
as a factor important to building security culture. Trust is discussed in many ways across articles. P7 
links trust to the confidence in employee actions and intentions. In addition, P25 relates to the 
protection of the organisation’s information from a human perspective, the safekeeping of private 
information and trust in the communications of the organisation. Moreover, in some articles, trust 
is not clearly defined (e.g., P30) and which makes it difficult to broadly appreciate who is trusting 
whom (e.g., employee trusting the organisation or vice versa) and what the trust specifically relates 
to. This highlights one of the challenges of drawing conclusive insights from the existing body of 
work. Alongside trust, commitment across employees suggests that the relationship between an 
organisation, its management and its users can determine the state of the security culture. 

In order to accomplish behaviour change and therefore establish a cyber security culture, Blythe et 
al. (2020) (P53) discuss the need for rewards and sanctions as part of a cyber security awareness 
campaign. Rewards or sanctions are practiced to bridge the knowledge-practice gap in cyber 
security awareness. This may also be considered as part of the motivation point above, depending 
on how it is applied. Another factor that has been identified as important in developing cyber 
security culture is that of establishing a network of champions (Alshaikh, 2020). As suggested, the 
cyber security champion role is to support the team in amplifying the security awareness messages, 
helping employees to adopt security behaviours identified from the policies as well as identifying 
SETA needs (skills, knowledge, and behaviours) and finally reporting progress back to the security 
team. 

3.5 Cyber security culture approaches, tools and/or frameworks  
A total of 37 studies explored approaches, tools, or frameworks regarding building or maintaining a 
security culture. P11, P38 and P50 focus on theoretical frameworks to guide the development of 
such security cultures. Conceptual information security culture models were developed by P9, P28, 
P29, P42, and P40. Although these are predominantly theoretical, they provide a basis of 
understanding for organisations to understand how a positive security culture can be cultivated and 
strengthened. For instance, Masrek et al. (2017) (P38) proposes a conceptual framework that 
decomposes such cultures into six dimensions, including management support, policy and 
procedure, compliance, awareness, budget and technology. This is an example of a framework built 
of dimensions that can be divided into factors that affect culture. 

Schein’s corporate culture model (1999) played a significant role in models developed by Van 
Niekerk and Von Solms (2010) (P6) and Reid and Van Niekerk (2014) (P19). The basis of this model is 
that there are three levels of corporate culture; artifacts, espoused values and shared tacit 
assumptions. P6 proposed that to create information security culture, an additional level of 
information security knowledge should be added to support the other three levels, as knowledge is 
a key part of a security culture. Therefore, according to this model, corporate culture is the basis of 
the Information Security Culture Model. Both studies use Schein’s corporate culture model with the 
additional level of knowledge as a basis of understanding the structure of security culture; (P6) 
suggest that a good security culture would have each of the four levels higher than the “minimum 
acceptable baseline”. 

The use of the STOPE framework by Bakry (2004) was also proposed by three studies to act as the 
foundation, or “building blocks” upon which a framework could be built to guide the development 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

of a security culture (P12; P20; P21). AlHogail (2015b) (P21) combined the Information Security 
Culture Framework from AlHogail (2015a) (P20) and the STOPE framework to create a new 
approach to understanding information security culture. The combined framework consists of five 
dimensions, which are Strategy, Technology, Organization, People, and Environment, and the aim is 
to cover four domains of human behaviour factors; preparedness, responsibility, management, and 
society and regulations (AlHogail and Mirza, 2014a). It also includes change management principles 
to encourage and support the needed change within organisations.  

Change management processes and models have been proposed by P18, P39 and P51. Change 
management relates to persuading employees to change their behaviour to better align with what 
the organisation requires (Van’t Wout, 2019). Da Veiga (2018) (P39) explores a holistic approach to 
change management with the Information Security Culture Change Management (ISCCM) approach. 
This aims to move organisations towards a positive security culture by managing the risks presented 
by human factors in the safeguarding of information. It is constructed of four phases to manage and 
implement behaviour change. Additionally, the Information Security Culture Change Framework by 
AlHogail and Mirza (2014a) (P12) focuses on cultivating information security culture through 
modifying behaviour, by integrating change management principles and examining human 
elements. 

The ARCS framework by Govender et al. (2020) (P55) suggests that the key drivers to 
understanding, managing, supporting and changing information security culture are driven by 
understanding the current state of information security, investing in specific initiatives that help to 
reduce cost while also reducing information security risk, and creating a sustainable approach to 
managing and improving information security culture. The framework uses a set of questions on the 
quality and efficacy of the state of information security assessments, cost reduction and culture 
within the organisation. 

Within the papers reviewed, a small subset (P5; P33; P42; P49) target Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) and Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs). SMEs are organisations that 
often struggle with limited resources, therefore tools developed for larger firms are not always 
usable due to affordability or complexity (de Araújo Lima, Crema and Verbano, 2020). Supported in 
the research, Santos-Olmo et al. (2016) (P33) explain that many frameworks created to improve 
information security culture are oriented towards larger organisations and lack factors necessary 
for smaller enterprises. Mokwetli and Zuva (2018) (P42) proposed a conceptual information 
communication and technology (ICT) security culture model made up of three categories; 
organisational, environmental and technological. The aforementioned study suggests that the 
adoption of the ICT model helps to minimise human error in SMMEs.  

While there are no articles that appear to outwardly state that the approach has been developed 
solely towards large organisations, studies such as Lacey (2010) (P3) and Tang et al. (2016) (P34) do 
specify that the projects undertaken have been carried out in larger organisations. Da Veiga et al. 
(2020) (P54) states small, medium and large organisations are represented in the study’s sample. 
Lacey (2010) (P3) reiterates that even large organisations often have low budgets and resources to 
direct towards developing effective change campaigns, which would be even more so the case for 
SMEs. More generally however, this does raise questions regarding the applicability of approaches 
for enterprises of varying sizes.

3.6 Cyber security culture metrics  
A total of 36 studies attempted to assess cyber security culture. Examples of these include P26, P30, 
P40, P45 and P49. Questionnaires and surveys were the most frequently used tool to allow for 
some level of measurement. Lacey (2010) (P3) provides some reasoning behind the use of 
questionnaires, explaining that these instruments can provide useful metrics, allowing organisations 
to measure understanding and consider which areas of employee knowledge need intervention.  

Across the review, 17 studies used individual questionnaires or surveys to assess employees within 
organisations, primarily concentrating on their knowledge of policy. Pertinent studies span P8, P15, 
P44, P57 and P53. Questionnaire items can be constructed in numerous ways; D’Arcy and Greene 
(2014) (P15) utilised previously validated items from existing measures, while Alnatheer et al. 
(2012) (P8) extracted questionnaire items utilising both expert feedback and responses from 
interviews to develop the instrument. Notable examples of questionnaire items in the latter 
include, “It is my responsibility to protect the information of my organisation” and “I am always 
educated or trained about new security policies”. Most studies, including the three examples 
mentioned above, used a five-point Likert scale to measure responses; 1 as strongly disagree and 5 
as strongly agree. One study (P23) used a seven-point Likert scale. 

The Information Security Culture Assessment (ISCA) instrument developed by Da Veiga and Eloff 
(2010) (P2) aims to both assess and monitor information security culture within an organisation. It 
is constructed from the Information Security Culture Framework (Da Veiga and Eloff, 2010) with 
seven information security component categories; these include leadership and governance, 
security management and operations, security policies, security program management, user 
security management, technology protection and operations, and change. The instrument consists 
of 85 statements, such as, “I understand how information security is managed in ABC to protect 
information” and “ABC is committed to information security in order to protect information” (Da 
Veiga and Eloff, 2010), all of which were measured on a five-point Likert scale. This demonstrates 
the type of questions that assess awareness and perception regarding protection of information. 

Da Veiga and Martins (2015) (P25) also used the ISCA questionnaire instrument, relying on items 
which focused on the human aspects of information security culture. An example item is, “I believe I 
have a responsibility regarding the protection of ABC’s information assets (e.g., information and 
computer resources)”, thus substantiating that a strong cyber security culture is considered as 
when employees are protecting and governing data at all times. The assessment focuses on 
understanding where employee knowledge, behaviour and attitudes lie; this is what is perceived to 
shape the security culture.  

One instrument proposed by Da Veiga (2016a) (P30) is the cyber security culture research 
methodology (CseCRM). At the time of their study, a reliable tool was needed to measure cyber 
security culture and understand the level of risk due to human aspects. In this methodology, one of 
the key stages is the cyber security culture measuring instrument. The questionnaire used consisted 
of 11 dimensions, some of which included change, privacy perception, user management and 
cybersecurity in practice. Two example items cover, “I know what the risk is when opening emails 
from unknown senders, especially if there is an attachment” and “I use my work e-mail address on 
social networking sites”, measured on a five-point Likert scale.  

Other types of tools were also used to assess security culture; for example, short tests can be seen 
in two studies (P5; P33). These were developed for SMEs with the aim to help create and cultivate a 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

positive security culture within smaller companies, without leading to high costs to maintain over 
time. Santos-Olmo et al. (2016) (P33) used a testing process which included security-related 
questionnaires. The user had to answer 50% or more of the questions correctly for the level of 
knowledge to be deemed as adequate. A 50% threshold in itself, being a potentially debatable 
approach to judgement.  

Training sessions in combination with surveys are also used to assess information security culture, 
as seen in Olivos (2012) (P10). To assess knowledge, the study used a questionnaire to examine 
each individual’s learning style to ensure each type was taken into account during the session. They 
proceeded to utilise training groups which involved employees taking a pre-test, engaging in a 
presentation, and taking a post-test to test for new knowledge. For instance, at the beginning of the 
session, only three out of ten employees agreed that they, “would not provide their password to 
another person under any circumstance”. After the presentation, all participants knew not to 
provide their password. 

Table 6 documents the various types of metrics and some of the respective assessment instrument 
used to assess cyber security culture generally. We note here that in some cases assessment types 
(e.g., specific questionnaires) have been reused by some authors, such as P31 and P35.

3.7 Key findings and contributions of prior research  
Upon reviewing the selected studies, the majority aim to contribute or extend on existing 
knowledge in the field. A recent study by Da Veiga et al. (2020) (P54) aimed to consolidate the 
existing perspectives on information security culture to try and inform a single definition of the 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

topic. The paper states that it is a guide to future work; it is cognisant of the issue of no universally 
agreed upon definition and the need to bring together approaches, frameworks and measurement 
tools present up to this point to standardise information security culture. 

For other studies (P4; P7; P23; P40), highlighting the importance of top management leadership and 
support was critical; the number of papers that mention this as a factor of security culture 
demonstrates this. Lim et al. (2010) (P4) concluded as with most articles that implementing and 
managing a healthy information security culture is difficult without the engaged involvement of top 
management.    

In addition, Batteau (2011) (P7) proposed that without creating a community and environment of 
trust, upon which cyber security culture can be built effectively, it is difficult to implement and 
cultivate it. Ioannou et al. (2019) (P44) also identifies the importance of building a feeling of trust, 
not only with management and the organisation, but also among personnel within an employee’s 
team. Organisational aspects are also focused on by Sherif et al. (2015) (P29) and Lopes and Oliveira 
(2014) (P17), who suggest that all aspects, from organisational, human and even to social, need to 
be considered when it comes to maintaining a cyber security culture. Key findings were also found 
in change management by three studies (P13; P39; P50). AlHogail and Mirza (2014b) (P13) findings 
suggest there is a crucial need for organisations to incorporate change management principles if a 
secure information security culture is to be built, due to the fact that actively seeing the correct 
behaviours in employees is a key part of positive change.  

Marotta and Pearlson (2019) (P45) concluded that it is vital to influence employees and cultivate a 
“solid and effective human firewall” to foster a strong cyber security culture. Lacey et al. (2010) 
claims that the field must move away from typical security culture procedures and processes and 
towards observing and engaging with users. Van’t Wout (2019) (P51) extends this idea, proposing a 
holistic approach towards developing and maintaining an organisational cyber security culture to 
design, develop and implement effective training and education programmes to ensure an 
improved cyber security culture. Another study (P58) found a positive relationship between 
organisational culture, security culture and security awareness. These findings all support the need 
for a broader approach.  

Another noteworthy area within this review was SMEs. Four studies (P5; P33; P42; P49) focused on 
these types of companies and how to assess their security culture. These act to acknowledge that 
SMEs may be different and require more tailored approaches. To add to this, it was intriguing that 
the discussion on rewards and punishments is presented only by one recent study (P53). The study 
identified that even if some kind of rewards (e.g., gifts and public recognition) or punishments (e.g., 
disciplinary warning, restriction of privileged access) are provided as part of an awareness 
campaign, they might not be used or applied by employees. Therefore, an effective culture 
campaign might not be effective with just the provision of these as incentives. 

4.  Discussion  
The purpose of this research is to examine the domain of cyber security culture, the factors 
essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a 
security culture and the metrics suggested to measure it. Having presented the most pertinent 
works in the last decade, this section discusses these with the intention of providing key insights for 
practitioners and researchers.

4.1 Definitions and characteristics of cyber security culture 
From analysing the studies discussing the definitions and characteristics of security culture, it 
becomes clear that there is no widely used definition. Although, when exploring the delineation 
between cyber security culture, information security culture and security culture, patterns emerge.   
Upon analysis of the descriptions, there are parallels in the various culture definitions identified and 
the broader organisational culture definitions. Nævestad et al. (2018) (P43) states that security 
culture can be seen simply as the security aspects of a wider organisational culture. Examining 
recent organisational culture literature, Oh and Han (2020) characterise organisational culture as 
whether employees are, “willing to participate in organisational learning activities”, which 
corroborates Nel and Drevin’s (2019) conclusion that information security culture is not only a 
subculture of organisational culture but should eventually become a part of organisational 
functions. From this perspective it is clear to recognise why so many definitions are referential to 
organisational culture, and the important role it plays. A takeaway point therefore is that security 
cultures need to be grounded in, and complementary of, wider enterprise culture efforts.  

Further regarding the characterisation of cyber security culture, we find that organisational 
expectations are the same across industries. This often relates to the way employees behave within 
the workplace and is reflected within the definitions and across security culture domains. For 
example, Hassan and Ismail (2016) (P32) characterised information security culture as employees 
making information security a natural part of the way they execute daily tasks within the 
organisation, when pertaining to healthcare environments. Masrek et al. (2018a) (P40) conducted 
their work in a public sector context, stating that employees must be skilful regarding information 
security, alongside organisations having policies in place to safeguard protected information.  

Marotta and Pearlson (2019) (P45) explore cyber security culture in the context of a large bank, 
characterising culture as the attitudes and values that encourage cyber-secure behaviours in 
employees in the organisation. Another definition (P58) describes cyber security culture as a sub-
culture of organisational culture, incorporating attitudes, beliefs, values and knowledge that 
individuals use to interact with the organisations systems, and conduct relevant procedures, daily 
tasks and activities. Mainly this definition describes culture as a habitual behaviour within 
organisations. The similarities between these definitions across industries and domains suggests 
that regardless of context, organisations and their employees are expected to conduct certain 
safeguarding behaviours and follow the procedures in place to fulfil security culture expectations.  

It is critical to mention that the emergence of cyber security culture is relatively recent; information 
security culture has been studied for significantly longer and dominates the review period as can be 
seen in Figure 4. Cyber security culture has become a more established terminology in the last 
decade in industry and the media (along with terms such as cyber-attack, cyber-threat, cyber-
espionage) but its prevalence in academic research is limited. This was a surprising finding and 
raises questions about the research view (or indeed, researchers’ view) of the term. 

Despite this, as the cyber security culture articles increase, it is vital to understand where the 
differences lie between terms. Although information security culture and cyber security culture 
have been defined as different concepts that can overlap, these terms are often used 
interchangeably within the literature. Gcaza, von Solms and van Vuuren (2015) agreed that there 
lacks a clearly articulated definition of the cyber-security culture domain, and this needs to be 
addressed by removing ambiguity that surrounds the vocabulary used in regard to cyber security 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

culture; however few studies in this review considered any differences between information and 
cyber security culture. 

With more investigation on how the aforementioned terms relate, we may be able to gather further 
insight on whether cyber security culture research should garner more focus than information 
security culture, though the literature may already be slowly moving in this direction. With cyber 
security culture articles on the increase, this could eventually replace information security culture 
research; this may, for instance, form part of legacy cyber security culture research. The wider field 
of research is also pertinent to this discussion as we have seen a rise in the number of journals using 
the ‘cyber’ term, and considering interdisciplinary research (thus encompassing work on security 
culture), such as the Journal of Cybersecurity and the Journal of Cyber Security Technology. 

4.2 Cyber security culture factors 
To support practitioners in implementing a cyber security culture, distilling years of academic work 
into key factors and frameworks is essential. This paper explored the factors considered important 
to both building and maintaining cyber security culture. From examining the literature, the most 
commonly mentioned factor is top management support, and this factor appeared consistently 
over the ten-year period reviewed. There could be several reasons for this; without the support of 
management, cyber security initiatives may not appear significant to employees in comparison to 
their day-to-day tasks. It is with the support of management that cyber security culture can be given 
the attention it requires, i.e., resources will be provided and directed where needed. Therefore, 
management must not only guide employee attention to cyber security culture efforts but also 
ensure resources are managed correctly.  

This need for senior support for security has challenged organisations for decades as security is 
often viewed as an inhibitor rather than an enabler of business. In itself, this highlights the need for 
a mindset change in the industry on how cyber security is perceived. We may already be witnessing 
a push for this change due to regulations/legislations such as the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (considering the significant fines for 
organisations found to be lacking in their security) (Sirur et al., 2018; Forbes, 2020) and the growth 
in cyber insurance (with insurance acting as a financial backstop in cases of cyber-incidents) (Nurse 
et al., 2020). Both of these points have nudged cyber security towards a board-level topic that can 
impact the longevity of an organisation.  

The research also demonstrates the need for clearer and more easily accessed policies and 
procedures. Greig et al. (2015) (P26) found that some employees of the retail organisation studied 
had never seen the company policies. Similarly, for Olivos (2012) (P10), the security policies had not 
been shared with employees because they were divided across multiple documents. For these 
studies, this demonstrated a significant issue with the extent of a security culture. It is up to both 
management and IT departments to ensure that employee knowledge of policy is at the required 
level, and individuals are exposed to up-to-date and relevant security information policies needed 
for their domain.  

It is pertinent to note that the significance of these factors could shift due to other aspects 
becoming more noteworthy. Research indicates that the behavioural tendencies of employees are 
important as well, and potentially overlooked. Examining human aspects specifically, Van’t Wout 
(2019) (P51) proposes that organisations should take a more customised approach to cyber security 
culture, and suggests that employees within the company be assessed from a more psychological 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

perspective, looking at concepts such as personality, interests, and needs and motivations. 
Personality is discussed in three papers (P50; P54). All three of these articles were released in the 
last two years, demonstrating that taking personality into account is increasing in the literature. 
This is also in line with the increasing cyber security culture research in the last five years. A 
potential concern with this direction is regarding the privacy of employees themselves. For 
instance, gathering personality information could be useful in creating more customised cyber 
security culture programmes in organisations, but privacy concerns from employees could result in 
individuals not wanting to share such personal information with their employer. 

Apart from personality, other factors have been discussed as important to both building and 
maintaining cyber security culture. Blythe et al. (2020) (P53) discuss the factor of rewards and 
sanctions as part of a cyber security awareness programme. A difficult question that can arise is to 
what extent should sanctions go for employees who fail to assimilate. And, if an employee is a high 
performer in their job, but fails to integrate into the enterprise’s security culture (or consistently 
performs poorly in awareness or behaviour), what should the organisation do in response? In 
addition, the importance of establishing a network of champions (Alshaikh, 2020) has been 
identified as crucial. The main role of champions would be amplifying the security awareness 
messages and supporting the implementation of policies as well as the needs of employees. Overall, 
this approach aims to promote the development of norms within an organisation with champions 
acting as the role models. Work external to academia has also pointed to the importance of security 
champions and further supports this perspective (Infosec Institute, 2018).  

Additionally, a somewhat unique factor included in four papers is national culture (P12; P35; P49; 
P54). The appearance of this factor, particularly in recent articles, could suggest that the cyber 
security culture at a national level also plays a key part of building a corporate cyber security 
culture. This is suggested in Gcaza, von Solms and van Vuuren (2015) where an ontology of national 
cyber security culture is developed, which includes concepts such as workforce education and 
SMMEs. Bada, Von Solms and Agrafiotis (2018) examined national cyber security awareness in 
African countries, and concluded that after areas of national needs for awareness campaigns are 
identified, different stakeholders from various sectors should become involved, and the audience 
therefore should include executive board members and employees of SMEs. This arguably has a 
trickle-down effect – when cyber security is regarded at a national level, this in turn helps establish 
these efforts in organisations; this can be applied to cyber security culture also. A future study could 
explore a similar idea by examining how national cyber security culture could be cultivated, 
however it is also imperative to note that building the culture of a nation would be significantly 
more of a challenge in comparison to an organisation. 

4.3 Cyber security culture approaches, tools and/or frameworks  
This section reflects on the approaches, tools and frameworks that have been identified in the 
literature. As mentioned in Section 4.1, it is difficult not to take into account the role that 
organisational culture plays, particularly given the studies that expand on Schein’s Corporate 
Culture Model (P6; P10; P19) and those that suggest that security culture is a subculture of 
organisational culture. These studies demonstrate that there is validity in viewing cyber security 
culture as a subculture, however Whelan (2017) postulates that to really understand subcultures 
within and between organisations, there is much more research to be done in this field. For 
instance, only five articles in this review had explicit mention of organisational culture in their 
approaches, including P29 and P34.  

22 

 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

In addition, another frequently referenced model is the STOPE framework proposed by Bakry 
(2004); three articles also form their foundation and expand this (P12; P20; P21). It is meaningful to 
note that the STOPE framework and the Corporate Culture model have features in common; 
AlHogail and Mirza (2014a) (P12) propose that their organisational dimension consists of four layers 
which are “artifacts, values, shared assumption, and knowledge”, the same three levels in Schein’s 
Corporate Culture Model and the additional fourth level from Van Niekerk and Von Solms (2010) 
(P6). This suggests that even across frameworks, the key aspects that build these models are often 
the same. For those seeking to develop security cultures therefore, this is advantageous as 
conflicting base models may not need to be navigated to plan an approach.  

Change management is an approach that has appeared more recently in research over the last ten 
years, with papers such as P13, P39 and P51 which highlight the more holistic manner of cultivating 
and maintaining a more positive security culture. The implementation of change management 
frameworks is often complicated in nature because it can affect all activity in an organisation. While 
this approach has benefits, it must be taken into account that organisations have to be aware of the 
impacts of change, such as resistance to change, especially if the change is considered to disrupt the 
working environment (Stavros et al., 2016), as well as potential incompetence of change agents 
(Jalagat, 2016). Change management must be paired with knowledge from the employees and 
management to be able to implement and maintain change. 

Arguably change management can play a role in SMEs, and how they are often overlooked in cyber 
security culture frameworks. Smaller organisations have a different organisational culture, down to 
structure, size and resources. For instance, Ling (2017) determined that SMEs find it more useful to 
have access to information from different departments for a more integrated and consolidated 
view; this potentially makes information security even more important in these smaller 
organisations. We should also note that research has found that only 15% of small businesses have 
a formal cyber incident management process (Lloyd, 2020); thus, further stressing the little 
emphasis that many SMEs place on security. Approaches geared towards SMEs are essential within 
cyber security culture research as one framework is unlikely to work for all types of organisations; a 
broad range of approaches and tools are crucial. These organisations often constitute a significant 
portion of businesses – in the UK for instance, 99.9% of businesses are SMEs (BEIS, 2020). 
Considering change in these enterprises, a study conducted by Stavros et al. (2016) found that 
employees of the SME were open to change as long as a number of factors were involved, some of 
which were communication, involvement and training. This further highlights the importance of 
organisational culture, and how despite the approach taken to building security culture, managing 
employees is hugely important. 

We also must note the fact that many of these frameworks have not been tested in real 
organisations. It is essential for the conceptual models that have not been tested in organisations to 
conduct future studies whereby these approaches are tested in corporate companies for external 
validity; theory-based models do not always provide guidance on how these can be applied in an 
organisation. This will help with another challenging issue, which is how organisations choose which 
framework or tool will work best for them. Many of the tools are general and not specific to a type 
of firm or industry, which makes it even more difficult for companies to narrow down the best 
approach for their organisation. This issue highlights the importance of frameworks such as those 
for SMEs or for specific industries like healthcare or banking, as companies can pick a suitable 
approach for fostering cyber security culture in their organisations.

4.4 Cyber security culture metrics 
When examining the metrics used to assess cyber security culture, the most apparent detail is that 
questionnaires and surveys are the main instrument to either assess knowledge or awareness of 
security policy. While these techniques cannot be undervalued (Rantos, Fysarakis and Manifavas, 
2012), and despite their dominance in the literature, the use of these methods do present 
challenges for organisations.  

Firstly, measuring knowledge can be useful in some cases but as Fertig et al. (2020) discuss in regard 
to security awareness, it cannot be assumed that knowledge influences behaviour. Employees may 
be aware of the policy, but this does not always correlate to displayed behaviour; for some 
organisations, we actually note that policy is instead used to identify areas of focus. This has been 
discussed in depth before by Bada et al. (2015), who also concluded that individuals often do not 
comply with defined policies or behaviours which may be expected of them. Furthermore, as we 
have seen in more targeted compliance-oriented research, there are a range of complex 
antecedents to security policy compliance (Cram, D’arcy and Proudfoot, 2019) and several theories 
and behaviour models to explain compliance (or the lack of it) (Moody, Siponen and Pahnila, 2018). 
These are ongoing deliberations and highlight the challenges around understanding and assessing 
actions of employees – most notably, as a platform for behaviour change.  

Fertig et al. (2020) concludes that questionnaires alone to assess knowledge is not enough to 
measure information security awareness; it is the combination of acquiring metrics on both 
behaviour and knowledge that produces a sufficient measurement for security awareness, and 
plausibly this conclusion can be applied to cyber security culture. As an effort to include the 
behaviour component, for example, studies (P52; P56) have used compliance to policies and 
reporting to managers/compliance officers as metrics to assess employee behaviour and therefore 
develop a cybersecurity culture.  

Arguably, studies that only use questionnaires are sufficiently measuring knowledge, but not 
behaviour. Nevertheless, studies such as P10, P26 and P49 that include training sessions, 
observation methods and roundtables, may consist of more reliable data on whether employees 
are truly displaying security aware behaviour in day-to-day situations. We stress that this does not 
mean questionnaires are not useful; Rantos, Fysarakis and Manifavas (2012) explain that it is crucial 
to prioritise sessions that refresh employee knowledge, because this is where the necessary 
security behaviour is learned. It is necessary that organisations take into account that both 
knowledge and behaviour need to be tested and observed where resources allow, as this will give 
the most accurate assessment of the state of cyber security culture. 

A challenge that is faced particularly in theory-based literature is identifying metrics. Choosing a 
method of assessment can appear vague when metrics are not exhaustive, as seen in Reid et al. 
(2014) (P18) which details the General Living Systems theory. One of the processes mentioned is, 
“identify metrics, measure and milestones”, but it does not then explain the type of metric that 
would be fit for measuring an information security culture system. It is important to mention that 
the previous step requires defining small actions that will encourage and motivate employees to 
create culture change, but the type of measure required for this process is unclear from the 
research. Despite the theory being well-developed and innovative, this demonstrates how complex 
it is to measure information security culture from any perspective. 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

Exploring whether the domains of cyber security culture are measured any differently in 
comparison to information security culture, there are no clear differences in terms of the metrics 
used. However, the differences appear in the items used in questionnaires. For example, Da Veiga 
(2016b) (P31) used the Information Security Culture Assessment to measure cyber security culture; 
the primary difference was the incorporation of elements that were related to the protection of the 
individual, rather than solely the protection of data and information systems. This is a useful way to 
demonstrate that information security culture can be incorporated into cyber security culture; as 
we have demonstrated earlier, the two domains possess similarities.  

It is possible that the most significant issue to mention is measuring cyber security culture over 
time. Measuring only one point in time is a challenge that is faced with using tools such as 
questionnaires. These metrics provide a snapshot of an organisation’s cyber security culture at a 
single moment, and unless they are completed at regular intervals there is a risk of not providing 
sufficient measurement of improvement or maintenance. One study by Da Veiga and Martins 
(2014) (P16) conducted assessments of an organisation’s information security culture four times 
over eight years, which provided a longitudinal view of the company’s information security culture 
with evidence of recommendations and improvement. When examining a corporation over time, 
this allows trends to be identified, and provides better evidence of whether security culture is being 
cultivated and maintained.  

It is essential to appreciate that organisational environments (and threat landscapes) often change 
and as such, security cultures may need to be constantly nurtured (European Union Agency for 
Cybersecurity, 2018); thus, also suggesting that cyber security culture must be measured regularly. 
This raises a related question for practitioners and researchers about the need for more dynamic 
metrics and measurement tools. Organisational monitoring tools are commonplace especially for 
protection against both external and internal threats (e.g., Security information and event 
management (SEIM) software). There are, however, important considerations about the use of 
these tools for supporting nurturing of security cultures as opposed to detecting threats. This 
quickly relates to the balance between enterprise security and employee privacy.  

4.5 Open issues in cyber security culture research 
When reviewing the research, one of the challenges discussed by Marotta and Pearlson (2019) 
(P45) is change. This has become a widely regarded issue, evident in the increasing research on 
change management. Senior management teams must deal with the issue of not only fostering 
security culture, but discovering procedures outside of organisational frameworks that will 
appreciate the need and use for new policies on security (Marotta and Pearlson, 2019). Most 
notably, while security policies and related research has existed for decades, there are still 
ambiguities on how such policies are best developed (Paananen, Lapke and Siponen, 2020). Lacey 
(2010) (P3) takes this point further, stating that security culture research needs more focus on soft 
psychology ideals such as change management and education. While Section 3 has shown that 
training has been considered a highly essential factor to building and maintaining security culture, 
Pătraşcu (2019) (P48) illustrates that educating on cyber security culture is much more of a non-
trivial process. Research has shown that regular training sessions often do not have the desired 
results; statistics show that as much as 50% of information from training sessions to improve 
security understanding are lost in an hour, 70% lost in 24 hours and 90% within a week (Ghafir et 
al., 2018).  

25 

 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

It is also prudent to acknowledge that every organisation is different; P48 explains that corporations 
have their peculiarities as well as personal information and IT infrastructures, and this presents a 
challenge when allocating approaches for use in organisations. Each organisation needs to apply an 
approach or framework in a way that fits the systems and structures already in place. As Govender 
et al. (2020) (P55) suggest, “the key drivers to understanding, managing, supporting and changing 
information security culture are driven by understanding the current state of information security, 
investing in specific initiatives that help reduce cost while also reducing information security risk, 
and creating a sustainable approach to managing and improving information security culture”. 
However, the individuality of each organisation and every employee can be viewed as an issue that 
needs to be addressed alongside cyber security culture research; the application of approaches is 
arguably as important as the approach itself. Use, testing and in-situ validation of proposed 
approaches is also crucial. From our review, it is apparent that few security culture approaches are 
evaluated (or evaluated over a notable length of time) and thus, it is challenging to understand their 
real value to practitioners or to the research field. Future work is desperately needed here if we are 
to truly address the challenges to security in organisations. 

The STOPE framework by AlHogail (2015b) (P21) proposed a more complex model that allows 
human aspects to be considered in a more effective way. Going forward, more combinational, 
multidimensional frameworks that address various domains may be needed to expand on existing 
perspectives. There is a need to further examine personalities and individual differences such as the 
learning styles and individual metrics, briefly explored in Olivos (2012) (P10). Employees are 
different and therefore will have preferences (innate and explicit) in the training and education 
programmes they engage with; this also impacts any metrics used to assess behaviour. According to 
Fertig et al. (2020), metrics should meet the individuality of every employee, so all employees need 
to be considered by the metrics. Da Veiga and Martins (2015) (P25) express that there are benefits 
to having robust items to be applied in questionnaires across the research field to benchmark cyber 
security culture postures across enterprises. This difference in perspectives is noteworthy but there 
may be a balance that can be reached to the advantage of the entire field of research and practice. 
Future research should therefore explore a balanced approach between the individuality of 
employees and organisations and creating a standardised set of questions (which may also be open 
to tailoring depending on business/sector context) to assess cyber security culture. 

4.6 Practical implications 
Developing and maintaining a robust security culture has challenged businesses for decades. This 
has been made more complex by the abrupt move to remote working and increasing set of cyber-
attacks, linked to the Covid-19 pandemic (Lallie et al., 2021). Having discussed the open research 
issues in Section 4.5, this section considers the implications of our work to practice and industry.  

The first area in which we add value is in the up-to-date aggregation of factors and metrics core to 
the advancement and preservation of an organisation’s security culture; also including recent 
discussions on cyber security culture. As has been shown, there are an increasing number of articles 
published on security culture, each focusing on different components (e.g., on factors, metrics or 
case studies). This research can help to provide a reference point for businesses which highlights 
primary factors witnessed over the last ten years such as top management support, accountability 
and trust. Moreover, we call attention to other less well-known factors including the need for a 
network of security culture champions or ambassadors (that can encourage and promote good 
security behaviour) and the underlying role that national culture plays in an enterprise’s security 
culture. These seem underrepresented in current literature, and at least require more study. This 

26 

 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

article’s findings can make a difference in security culture strategies being planned for the next 
decade in terms of where organisations may focus or where they may look to explore new factors. 

Another important finding pertains to the fact that organisations cannot “plug and play” security 
culture approaches from elsewhere and expect them to work. Instead, to create a strong positive 
culture, businesses can begin with their current organisational culture, consider the security aspects 
important to them as well as the many factors identified in Section 3, and plan as appropriate. 
Short-term, one-off training and education campaigns have limited success in changing behaviour 
or engendering culture, and it is crucial that technical (e.g., types of threats) as well as softer (e.g., 
personality types and change management) aspects are incorporated in culture planning. 
Furthermore, to build or improve an organisation’s culture, the development of appropriate culture 
metrics is essential. Surveys and questionnaires are easy to execute but have notable weaknesses 
(e.g., focus on quantitative data, may suffer from self-report biases, and are at a single point in 
time). The reality therefore is that there are no clear recommended metrics and more research is 
required in this domain. It would also be helpful for academics to work towards clearly defined 
factors (e.g., potentially looking at “trust in organisations” or “trust in employees” as factors instead 
of a general “trust” factor), as they can then provide a better basis for the creation of specific, more 
granular metrics.  

To follow on from the various points above, it would also be ideal for the field if practitioners and 
researchers worked closer together on cyber security culture approaches, frameworks and metrics. 
We found an abundance of theoretical works and multiple articles which outline proposals to build 
or measure culture but fail to evaluate them in-situ in medium-to-long-term studies. This makes it 
difficult to ascertain the true value of the work and its ability to positively impact culture in 
organisations. If practitioners and researchers collaborate, researchers will have access to real 
organisations to apply, adapt, evaluate and refine their new research, and practitioners will gain 
access to research expertise – not always accessible – on topics from psychology and computing to 
sociology and organisational behaviour. This would ultimately lead to the design and development 
of robust set of approaches and metrics suitable for those organisations. Moreover, considering the 
academic impetus to publish articles and share anonymised datasets, these collaborations would 
also result in contributions that can advance the field for all parties involved (e.g., researchers could 
analyse datasets to experiment with new proposals, and companies could gain insights into how 
researchers and practitioners could work better together). 

4.7 Related research reviews 
As mentioned in Section 1, there have been other systematic literature reviews which have 
investigated the topic of security culture. It is important, therefore, to reflect on how our research 
contributions compare and contrast to their findings, and ultimately, what is the novelty of our 
research given such reviews. Three of the most recent and relevant – given their specific focus on 
security culture – of these articles are Glaspie & Karwowski (2017), Nasir et al. (2019a) and Sas et al. 
(2020).  

Glaspie & Karwowski (2017) engage in a study to identify the human factors that contribute to an 
organisation’s security culture. In this domain, they define and discuss five overarching areas, 
information security policy, deterrence and incentives, attitudes and involvement, training and 
awareness and management support. Our work has identified these areas as well, and therefore 
acts to further validate that research. We have also identified a range of additional factors including 
communication, trust, user management and national culture; all of which are increasingly 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
This paper is a preprint of an article submitted to Computers & Security Journal (2021) 

pertinent to building a corporate culture of security. The topic of metrics is also not considered in 
Glaspie & Karwowski’s research, even though there is mention of the importance of varying training 
according to employees’ needs. Metrics are central to discussions on security culture as it is a 
primary way in which culture can be firstly assessed and then, improved.  

In Nasir et al. (2019a), a PRIMSA-informed systematic review of the dimensions of an information 
security culture is presented. Their work assesses dimensions across articles and deliberates these 
in the context of the theories and approaches that articles ground information security culture in. 
There are several commonalities in dimensions (or factors, as we refer to them) across our two 
articles, and as to be expected considering the overlap in the date ranges (2000-2017, 2010-2020) 
used for article inclusion, many key references reoccur. An interesting point raised by Nasir et al. is 
the variation in dimensions in the literature and even disparity in the meaning of words used for 
what might be perceived as the same dimension/factor (e.g., trust). This is not an area that we have 
considered but is certainly one that deserves further research; though efforts to standardise 
language and terminology, even within the security field, are notoriously difficult (ENISA, 2019).  

Our work also supports Nasir et al.’s earlier findings pertaining to the notable use of organisational 
culture as a basis for many proposed security culture models. In many ways, we view our research 
as complementary to Nasir et al. as we explore areas not considered in their work. For instance, we 
examine the changing use of terminology from security culture to information security culture and 
cyber security culture, and its implications for ongoing work (with ‘cyber’ clearly focused beyond 
information security alone). Moreover, we investigate the approaches/metrics (e.g., questionnaires, 
surveys, interviews) used to assess security culture, and identify weaknesses in current practice and 
thus avenues for further work (i.e., more dynamic and holistic techniques for measurement).   

Sas et al. (2020) study the security culture from the perspective of measurement tools. From their 
search, 16 tools are identified with six then examined in detail. A key finding from their work is the 
attention paid to quantitative (as compared to qualitative) tools in the literature – this is 
comparable to the results of our study which found that surveys and questionnaires were 
predominately used to assess security culture. The solution to this concern is a range of metrics and 
tools. Sas et al. (2020) suggest a mix-methods approach. Our work, as shown in earlier sections, 
extends this and suggests more rounded, but also more dynamic methods of assessment. Such 
methods would allow a wider analysis of the organisation’s security culture as well as reducing the 
burden on employees to actively participate – excessive active participation can also draw 
employees away from work which may impact job satisfaction and productivity.   

Lastly, we believe there is value in the descriptive analysis that was conducted in our work which 
was largely absent in the other review articles covered above. From our analysis, we identified 
primary venues where research into security culture is published; this could serve as a guide for 
future authors. The examination into the use of terms, from security culture to cyber security 
culture, is unique to our work, as we aim to demystify such terminology, including the most 
noteworthy commonalities and differences. Furthermore, this study highlights the more prolific 
geographic centres of security culture research, with South Africa featuring prominently and a 
somewhat surprising lack of representation from the US, UK and Europe more broadly. Our finding 
would suggest the need for more research from these regions, particularly considering their role in 
global cyber security affairs (as superpowers, but also as countries that face significant cyber-
attacks on organisations on a daily basis (CSIS, 2020)).

4.8 Limitations 
Due to the nature of the research field, the articles were primarily dominated by information 
security culture (instead of security culture or cyber security culture) research. While these are all 
extremely relevant, looking at security culture from a wider perspective, or specifically cyber 
security culture, was limited and may be biased towards information security. However, within the 
realms of this study, information security culture still falls under cyber security culture. 

Many measures were taken to ensure that all of the relevant papers within the ten-year period 
review were included in this study, but there exists a possibility that not all papers relating to 
information security culture, cyber security culture or security culture were included. Also, as 
mentioned, three studies were not included as they could not be accessed; therefore, it is possible 
that some conclusions about recent research may be missed. Considering the capture of articles 
across the period however, and the similarity of our findings to existing reviews, we expect that this 
would have had a minimal impact on our findings.  

5.  Conclusion 
Cyber security culture by its nature needs to be cultivated rather than rigidly designed and this is 
apparent in the research. Despite the wide scope of theories and approaches covered, similar 
aspects and characteristics of continuously fostering culture reappear across the literature. 
Exploring cyber security culture (inclusive of information security culture and security culture) has 
allowed us to uncover the advancements as well as challenges that are currently faced in the field.  

This systematic review has covered multiple research areas within cyber security culture, and from 
the 58 selected articles we have drawn the following conclusions: 

●  Definitions and characteristics. There are patterns between cyber and information security 

culture definitions. There is also a clear relationship between cyber security and 
organisational culture definitions. Despite these parallels, there is no universally agreed 
upon description. As industry moves further towards the use of the term ‘cyber security 
culture’, it will be worth monitoring how research uptake changes – if at all – as 
demonstrated by articles in the field. Furthermore, organisations should note that cyber 
security culture often focuses broader than the protection of data/information.   

●  Factors. There are multiple aspects that reappear across articles and the domains of cyber 

security culture. These work together; despite the frequency of top management elements, 
this does not cultivate good culture without other factors such as responsibility and trust, 
which are more personal features. Change management and national culture are more 
recent factors that require additional research in the future. 

●  Approaches and frameworks. Theoretical frameworks on cyber security culture dominate 

the research. The approaches used vary, but some struggle to be applicable across 
organisations sizes who do not have the same resources (e.g., SMEs versus large 
corporates), and industries who must manage different issues. This raises questions about 
the pursuit of multiple approaches which can be further tailored to a sector or company as 
needed.  It is also apparent that the proposal of frameworks at a conceptual / theoretical 
level significantly outweighs the extent of assessment in practice.  There is also a clear need 
for in-situ use, testing and evaluation of proposed security culture approaches and 
frameworks to provide real-world evidence of their efficacy.

●  Metrics. Using questionnaires and surveys to measure knowledge of cyber security culture 
is mostly commonplace but does not always equate to measuring behaviour in day-to-day 
tasks. The only way that effective metrics will be created is through close interaction 
between practitioners and researchers, where practitioners can provide real-world 
environments for study and researchers can provide their expertise on metric design and 
evaluation. Such interactions will also allow medium- and long-term application and 
refinement of metrics, that can benefit organisations and advance the field more generally.  

Overall, the overriding gap in the literature is the opportunity to consider more than one type of 
factor, whether it be human or technical. Case studies work well for cyber security culture research 
as this allows for an ethnographic environment where employees can be witnessed doing day-to-
day roles and activities and provide more suitable metrics than solely tested knowledge. Therefore, 
next steps in research could be assessing an organisation and amalgamation of the multiple 
perspectives. It would also be beneficial to conduct studies on the role of psychology in employee 
behaviour and the protection of not only data, but cyberspace in general. Exploring whether models 
can be combined may be a noteworthy future study, such as Schein’s corporate culture model and 
the STOPE framework, which share similar dimensions. It would also be beneficial to explore change 
management programmes in organisations. Exploring national culture should also be considered for 
future studies.

Regulations 

Establishing a network of 
champions 

Rewards and sanctions 

The means utilised to share information between the 
organisation and its employees, for instance, means 
through which employees find out about security policies 
and practices and what is expected of them.  
The procedures that are in place to manage and monitor 
employee behaviour and compliance. 
Incentives provided to encourage employee adherence to 
security policies, practices and advice. 
Employees and the organisation need to have confidence in 
each other both generally and as it relates to security 
activities. This confidence is two-way and can relate to any 
activities within or about the organisation (e.g., trust in the 
organisation generally, trust that its policies are well 
considered, employees trusting their employer, etc.)  
This relates to the norms, values, beliefs and customs of 
the nation or region that an organisation or employee are 
based in; these can influence an organisation’s security 
culture. 
Behaviour and decision making within an organisation 
follow a moral code of right and wrong. Such code can 
impact how people adopt or engage with a security culture 
(especially if that culture is perceived as unethical or 
harmful).   
The legal provisions/directives in relation to safeguarding 
information technology and computer systems, which 
organisations and their employees need to abide by. 
Champions are members of an organisation who support 
activities in raising security awareness and act as a point of 
contact. Champions within different sections, departments 
or offices of an organisation create a network. 
Utilising an approach of rewarding employee behaviour 
which is security compliant, or penalising non-compliance 
which may result in a potential compromise of the 
organisation.
