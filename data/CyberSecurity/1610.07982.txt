The Third Offset and a Fifth Domain? 

Balancing Game-Changing Innovation and Cyber Risk Mitigation 

ABSTRACT 

Cyber  has  changed  the  scope  of  the  Navy’s  mission  and  is  placing  new  strains  on  our  diplomatic, 
warfighting,  legal,  and  economic/budgetary  processes.  Cybersecurity  processes  and  techniques  are 
increasingly critical to our warfighting missions, but they can also inhibit the pace and potential for high 
impact, game-changing innovation. Throughout its history, the Navy has shown the ability of innovation 
(in policy, process, and technology) to change the game when our security is on the line. We believe the 
Navy is capable of dramatically impacting not only the U.S. capabilities in cyber conflict and information 
operations, but also in cyber defense and information assurance, as well as cybersecurity for our society. 
While  cyber  risk  management  is  challenging,  the  Navy’s  transition  from  DoD  Information  Assurance 
Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) to the Risk Management Framework (RMF) has the 
potential to harmonize our cybersecurity efforts with our need (and demonstrated ability to provide) for 
game-changing  strategies,  tactics,  and  technologies.  We  offer  a  foundation  for  the  foregoing  assertions 
and  recommendations  on  ways  to  encourage  innovation  in  the  context  of  effective  cyber  risk 
management. 

INTRODUCTION 

Information  technology  has  given  us  a  new  warfighting  domain  replete  with  complexity  and  attacker 
advantages. Global players are dedicating enormous resources to wage real war in a virtual battlespace. 
The United States Navy, while having a heritage dominated by fighting on the world’s seas, also engages 
in the domains of land, air, and space. In recent years, considerable focus has turned to the cyber domain, 
‘the fifth domain’1. There is increasing acknowledgement that attackers presently enjoy a disproportionate 
advantage in the cyber domain in spite of our apparent resource superiority2. We must innovate both our 
processes and technologies in order to overcome the asymmetries3. We live in a precipitous time where 
we are still learning about the implications that come from a force that leverages technology in a highly 
interconnected way.

THE NAVY’S HISTORY OF INNOVATION 

The victor in an engagement is generally the adversary who has the military advantage; that is, a decisive 
asymmetry.  Thus,  a  tacit  objective  of  militaries  is  to  establish  and  maintain  this  asymmetry.  History 
shows  that  innovation  is  responsible  for  the  greatest  improvements  of  military  advantage;  our  Navy 
community can take credit for many of these.  

Discussions of innovation often focus on novelty and technology, but this scope is too narrow to apply 
meaningfully to warfighting. Innovation has many dimensions, none of which should be discounted. The 
Oxford English Dictionary defines innovation in one way as “the introduction of novelties; the alteration 
of what is established by the introduction of new elements or forms.”4 Game-changing innovations have 
come  in  the  form  of  novel  or  unexpected  strategies,  tactics,  and  technologies,  including  combinations 
thereof.  Innovative  technologies  and  processes  have  been  “game-changing”  because  they  dramatically 
and quickly rebalance the advantage.  

An  exemplary  case  is  the  US  Navy  Polaris  program,  which  resulted  in  the  first  submarine-launched 
ballistic missile (SLBM) more than 50 years ago. This complex and risky project produced a number of 
high-visibility technological advances in a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. However, 
the  greatest  innovation  may  have  come  from  advancements  in  the  disciplines  of  project  and  risk 
management. Admiral William Rayborn led the Special Project Office in charge of Polaris and delivered 
a critical capability three years ahead of schedule5. The success of this project was attributed to tools still 
used today, including the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). The development and use 
of  this  management  tool revealed the complexities  and  interdependencies  of  elements  in large  projects. 
Without this process innovation, it is likely that the project would have taken many years longer or been 
stopped without ever seeing success.  

Moreover,  the  success  of  the  Polaris  program  teases  at  one  of  the  critical  dimensions  of  disruptive 
innovation:  A  capability  like  SLBM  is  not  game-changing  unless  its  arrival  is  timely.  Broad  spectrum 
innovation naturally includes advancements in technology, but success may be ultimately determined by 
the economy of resources, including funding and time.  

There  have  been  moments  in  history  where  paired  strategic  and  technological  innovation  have  brought 
such  significant  advantages  that  they  have  been  deemed  ‘offsets’.  FitzGerald  defines  the  pursuit  of  an 
offset  as  a  strategy  that  allows  one  force  to  overcome  or  mitigate  another  force’s  advantages6.  This 
definition describes our position at the beginning of the Cold War: We were at a quantitative disadvantage 
relative to the Soviet Union and the rest of the Warsaw Pact with regard to the cost and complexity of 
projecting  a  conventional  force.  Leveraging  nuclear  deterrence  offered  enormous  savings  in  resources 
compared to conventional deterrence. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had countered our first offset 
capability  and  a  formal  Offset  Strategy  was  employed  to  tap  technology  as  a  force  multiplier.  The 
cornerstone of the second offset was the introduction of Global Positioning System (GPS) and precision 
munitions. Like the first offset, the second offset was effective for a finite period of time. The rest of the 
world has largely caught up to the United States in technological capability in the forty years since. It is 
no surprise that in 2014, then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called for a third offset capability7.

CYBER AND THE EFFECT ON INNOVATION 

Thomas Aquinas captured this maritime truism about risk-taking in his famous 13th century quote, “If the 
highest aim of a captain were to preserve his ship, he would keep it in port forever.8” Shallow inspection 
reveals  the  limitation  of  this  strategy.  A  port  berth  certainly  mitigates  some  risk,  but  warships  are  not 
effective fighting while moored to a pier and likely find themselves vulnerable to other grave threats.  

We  believe  cyber  defense  and  information  assurance  efforts  can  stifle  or  enable  game-changing 
innovation at a time when innovation is sorely needed. 

In  DoD,  information  security  has  an  institutionalized  history  of  being  compliance-oriented  rather  than 
risk-oriented. Moreover, in many sectors, attempts to move to risk-based approaches to cyber suffer from 
this compliance-oriented mindset and focus too much on negative risk, rather than on positive risk-taking. 
Frequent attacks, poor baseline security practices, organizational silos, and the challenges of attribution 
all  compound  the  problem  and  lead  organizations  to  an  either/or  approach  to  cyber:  Either  we  clamp 
down on risk-taking in dramatic fashion, or we live in denial of the enormity of the problem.  

We will not succeed in our mission if we operate at these extremes. To navigate the space where we can 
operate, while achieving the ‘right’ level of risk, we have turned to the discipline of risk management.  

THE CHALLENGE OF APPLYING RISK MANAGEMENT TO CYBER 

Cyber poses a formidable problem, and risk management tools, as commonly deployed, do not provide a 
simple  fix.  Problems  can  be  described  by  salient  properties  including  their  ease  of  solution.  Moreover, 
problems can be categorized by their difficulty. Most problems that we encounter, including those where 
risk management approaches are successful, are tame problems. A harder class of problems is wicked and 
is characterized by demonstrated resistance to being solved; for these problems, there is no guarantee of 
solution. Clemente’s well-written piece describes how cyber is a wicked problem9. Recently, researchers 
have identified an even harder class of problems: super wicked. Levin et al. describe these problems as 
being even more resistant to solution, not because of the problem itself, but because the agent(s) trying to 
solve it add to the difficulty10. We posit that cyber may be a super wicked problem11.  

Consider the two faces of cyber, offense and defense, and the reality that the Navy uses much of the same 
commercial  hardware  and  software  that  our  adversaries  do.  Addressing  a  known  vulnerability  in  our 
systems may also have the effect of denying us an offensive tool. Our actions clearly have the potential to 
increase the difficulty of the cyber problem.  

This  extreme  difficulty  explains  the  frustration  that  we  have  when  trying  to  apply  standard  risk 
management approaches to cyber. Cyber is simply not as tractable as problems like reliability or quality12. 
While there are likely others, we address three specific difficulties of applying standard risk management 
tools to cyber.

cyber to the design tradespace must be acknowledged.

The first two difficulties arise from approaches that equate risk management with risk assessment. Risk 
assessment  is  not  the  same  as  risk  management.  Risk  assessments  are  one  of  the  tools  used  in  risk 
management,  and  they  are  particularly  challenging  in  the  cyber  domain.  Risk  management  is 
fundamentally  about  informed,  coordinated  decision-making,  and  risk  assessments  are  only  one 
component  of  supporting  decision  making.  Others  include  established  best  practices,  and  strategic  goal 
setting for information security programs. Too much focus on risk assessment is a mistake, particularly 
where it is at the expense of valuable resources (like time), benefit assessment, and timely action-taking.  

In cyber, the first major obstacle to effective risk assessment involves the enumeration of risks. Standard 
risk management approaches call for listing all known risks. A program manager may claim that that they 
have  enumerated  all  risks;  a  counter-argument  to  this  program  manager  is  the  problem  of  `zero-day 
vulnerabilities’.  We  can  predict  the  general  existence  of  these  vulnerabilities  in  our  systems,  but  we 
cannot mitigate them until details of their existence are known. 

The  second  difficulty  of  conducting  cyber  risk  assessments  lies  in  the  assignment  of  the  likelihood 
estimations to adverse events. When faced with managing the risk posed by the reliability of electronics, 
there is a corpus of data, and reliable statistical models can be used to measure uncertainty. Within cyber, 
we face a severe lack of actuarial data or other efficient methods to determine the likelihood of adverse 
events. 

The  third  difficulty  involves  the  limitations  of  risk  management  approaches  to  non-static  boundary 
conditions. The sinking of the USS Thresher in 1963 led to the introduction of the US Navy SUBSAFE 
program. The threat addressed by SUBSAFE is pressurized water that may impinge on the integrity of a 
submarine.  The  difficulty  of  addressing  this  threat  is  bounded  by  the  invariant  laws  of  physics:  Water 
behaves the same way today as it behaved in 1963. In the cyber domain, attackers evolve intelligently and 
quickly,  and  the  complexity  and  interconnectedness  of  our  information  systems,  and  number  of 
vulnerabilities, may be evolving at an even faster pace. While the threats and terrain shift, we understand 
relatively little about cyber’s immutable laws and principles, assuming they exist. Cyber risks are tied to 
potential adverse occurrences that may not be predicted by statistical or probabilistic models; rather, these 
risks are under the direct influence of intelligent, persistent, and well-resourced adversaries. Traditional 
risk management approaches fall short. 

BALANCING INNOVATION AND RISK IN THE CYBER DOMAIN 

Cyber  risk  management  is challenging,  and  in  itself  does  not  provide a  perfect  set  of tools  for  mission 
assurance. However, when contextualized in an organizational, mission-oriented environment it can be a 
flexible, cross-organization approach to managing risk and maximizing mission success. 

The practical and pragmatic core of any risk management approach to information security is the ability 
of  organizations  to  make  systematic,  informed  decisions  about  mitigating,  transferring,  avoiding,  and  – 
perhaps most importantly – accepting risks. Healthy approaches to risk management are aligned closely to 
enabling  the  organizational  mission.  Risk  acceptance  is  particularly  critical  in  any  domain  where  our 
ability to mitigate, transfer, or avoid risks is limited (i.e., residual risk cannot be reduced to zero), or risk-
taking  is  critical  to  the  organization’s  mission.  Warfighting  is  a  risk-taking  process,  and  innovation 
follows  suit.  Risk  management  holds  promise  for  the  cyber  domain  precisely  because  (when  truly 
embraced) its processes and outcomes acknowledge that we have a mission to accomplish in spite of the 
risks over which we cannot exert perfect control. The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)13 holds 
promise for the Navy because we must intentionally accept some cybersecurity risks in order to innovate 
and achieve our mission.

If risk management approaches are treated as compliance, ‘check the box’ regimes, they lose their utility.  

Information  security  risk  can  be  managed  to  enable  and  encourage  the  kinds  of  game-changing 
innovations  that  have  fueled  our  military  superiority.  But,  this  requires  a  rich  understanding  of  how 
innovation and risk relate. Just as we roughly quantify the risk level posed by an adverse threat event as 
approximately equal to the consequence should the event occur times the likelihood of it occurring (i.e., 
)14,  we  make  (sometimes  explicitly,  sometimes  implicitly)  a  similar 
calculation  when  we  aim  for  game-changing  innovations.  When  gauging  the  value  of  investment  in 
𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟  ≈ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  ⋅ 𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑜
innovation,  indeed the  value  inherent  in  accepting  certain  risks,  we  multiply  the  level  of  benefit  to our 
mission  should  the  investment  be  successful  by  the  likelihood  that  it  will  be  successful.  Where  the 
potential benefit is very high, the likelihood need not be so great.  

On  the  dark  side  of  risk,  we  often  talk  about  “black  swans.15”  These  are  very  high  impact,  very  low 
frequency events that can (and eventually do) happen. Because these risks are critical (even existential) 
and difficult to measure, risk managers of all kinds obsess over them, and rightly so. To reduce the risk 
associated with black swans we prepare to reduce their impact when they do happen, and (only with the 
most existential, most controllable threats) attempt to reduce their probability. On the positive side of risk, 
game-changing  innovations  are  precisely  the  flip  side  of  the  coin.  They  are  very  high  impact,  low 
frequency  changes  in  processes  and  technologies  that  drastically  increase  our  security,  resilience,  or 
ability to overcome an adversary. We lay the groundwork for game-changers by focusing our investments 
on  the  most  critical  problems  to  increase  innovation’s  impact,  and  distribute  that  investment  among 
innovation efforts, knowing that not every seed will sprout, to increase game-changer likelihood.  

We  can  and  must  continue  the  Navy’s  legacy  of  game-changing  process  and  technological  innovation, 
and cyber must enable, not stifle, that progress. Risk management, when embraced and done in the right 
way, can harmonize reasonable information security and sound risk-taking16.  

CONCLUSION 

In closing, we offer the following recommendations for managing cyber risk to encourage game-changing 
innovation: 

A.  Pair  process  innovation  in  cyber  with  technology  innovation  across  the  spectrum  of  naval 
capabilities  in  order  to  maximize  the  likelihood  of  game-changers  in  or  across  all  warfighting 
domains. 

B.  Select and deploy risk management techniques consistent with the Risk Management Framework 

that support not only informed, but also efficient, timely decision making.  

C.  Base  risk  and  innovation  decisions  on  their  mission  impact,  and  contextualize  information 
security  risks  in  the  context  of  mission  assurance.  Prioritize  cyber  risk  acceptance  that  is 
reasonably likely to reduce higher magnitude mission risks. 

D.  Work horizontally, across acquisition programs and operational commands, bringing key decision 
makers  to  the  same  table,  and  ensure  that  those  accepting  cyber  risk  are  well-positioned  to 
understand the mission impact. 

E.  Invest  in  understanding  the  cyber  terrain,  its  constant  attributes,  and  evolutionary  processes. 
Research and define how the cyber risk terrain differs across operational and R&D environments.

In  the  Analects,  Confucius  wrote,  “Study  the  past  if  you  would  define  the  future.”  Our  study  of  the 
Navy’s  history  of innovation  tells  us that  legacy  must  continue,  even  more  so  now  that  we  face  a new 
domain. We must take cyber risks seriously and reduce them where we can reasonably do so, and we (the 
authors)  spend  much  of  our  time  advocating  for  as  much.  However,  the  nature  of  the  Navy’s  mission 
demands  that  cyber  risk  be  viewed  in  light  of  need  for  game-changing  innovation  and  the  risk-taking 
required to achieve it.
