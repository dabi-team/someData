Abstract. Cyber-security breaches inÔ¨Çict signiÔ¨Åcant costs on organiza-
tions. Hence, the development of an information-systems defense capa-
bility through cyber-security investment is a prerequisite. The question
of how to determine the optimal amount to invest in cyber-security has
been widely investigated in the literature. In this respect, the Gordon-
Loeb model and its extensions received wide-scale acceptance. However,
such models predominantly rely on restrictive assumptions that are not
adapted for analyzing dynamic aspects of cyber-security investment. Yet,
understanding such dynamic aspects is a key feature for studying cyber-
security investment in the context of a fast-paced and continuously evolv-
ing technological landscape. We propose an extension of the Gordon-
Loeb model by considering multi-period and relaxing the assumption of
a continuous security-breach probability function. Such theoretical adap-
tations enable to capture dynamic aspects of cyber-security investment
such as the advent of a disruptive technology and its investment con-
sequences. Such a proposed extension of the Gordon-Loeb model gives
room for a hypothetical decrease of the optimal level of cyber-security
investment, due to a potential technological shift. While we believe our
framework should be generalizable across the cyber-security milieu, we il-
lustrate our approach in the context of critical-infrastructure protection,
where security-cost reductions related to risk events are of paramount
importance as potential losses reach unaÔ¨Äordable proportions. More-
over, despite the fact that some technologies are considered as disruptive
and thus promising for critical-infrastructure protection, their eÔ¨Äects on
cyber-security investment have been discussed little.

Introduction

Cyber-security breaches inÔ¨Çict signiÔ¨Åcant costs on organizations, businesses, and
individuals [4,13,21]. As a result, operators of information systems (IS) must
develop an IS-defense capability. In order to build a capability, investing in
material resources is a prerequisite [42,9,33]. In the context of cyber-security,
such material resources are composed by processes, products and/or services
that are related to the security management of IS in general and, among others,
to cyber-threats monitoring in particular [2,36,39,7] ‚Äì e.g., intrusion-detection
systems (IDS).

The cyber-security investment issue has received signiÔ¨Åcant academic atten-
tion (for an extensive literature review, see [36]), and such a literature is often
directly related to practitioners‚Äô needs. For instance, as organizations face budget
constraints, an important challenge for these same organizations is to maximize
the eÔ¨Éciency of any monetary investment in cyber-security processes, products
and/or services [12,20,36]. Prior IS research has produced many quantitative
models that propose to optimize such investment, as well as recommendations to
invest in particular technologies or systems (e.g., [12,24,26,29,38]). These formal
approaches are complemented by less formal practitioner-oriented discussions
[8,40,46]. Among all the available models and approaches, the Gordon-Loeb (GL)
model has received wide-scale acceptance [48]. The GL model is based on microe-
conomics ‚Äì more precisely on the fundamental economic principle of cost-beneÔ¨Åt
analysis [22,20] ‚Äì, establishing a general setup for determining the optimal level
of cyber-security investment. By specifying a security-breach probability func-
tion (SBPF), the GL model attempts to determine the above-mentioned optimal
investment amount for cyber-security processes, products and/or services (e.g.,
[10,22,28,20,47]).

However, the GL model framework evades dynamic issues such as perverse
economic incentives1 and the advent of a disruptive 2 cyber-security technology
[20]. Yet, in the case of the latter, accounting for such dynamic issues could
signiÔ¨Åcantly enrich the initial model by giving supplementary time-related in-
sights concerning the potential consequences that disruptive technologies might
trigger for cyber-security investment. If conventional cyber-security processes,
products and/or services such as IDS are essentially assimilated to the targeted

others [3].

2 In economic terms, the notion of disruptive technology [17] refers to a radically inno-
vative technology that signiÔ¨Åcantly disrupts existing economic structures, markets
and value networks, thus displacing established leading products, processes and/or
services [17]. Therefore, a disruptive technology comes from innovation. However, not
all innovations are disruptive, even though they can be revolutionary. For instance,
the advent of personal computers (PC) in the IT landscape can be considered as
a disruption. The multi-purpose functionalities of PCs, as well as their relatively
small size, their extended capabilities, and their low price facilitated their spread
and individual use. PCs displaced large and costly minicomputers and mainframes,
signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äecting the lives of individuals and the management of organizations.

event-based detection approach [2,39,7], the swift evolution of both the techno-
logical landscape and cyber-threats calls for a complementary approach based
on behavior-anomaly detection [2,39,45,15,18,34,43], and its subsequent (poten-
tially) disruptive technologies.

By extending the original GL model to a multi-period setup, and by re-
laxing the assumption of a continuously twice-diÔ¨Äerentiable SBPF, we create
room for additional insights on cyber-security investment by delivering a theo-
retical ground that enables to investigate the eÔ¨Äect of a disruptive technology
on such investment. In this article, we illustrate the concept of disruptive tech-
nologies through the case of big-data analytics3 (BDA) technologies and their
related techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed extension of
the GL model is the Ô¨Årst approach responding to the need of capturing the
aforementioned time-related insights that a disruptive technology might bring
on cyber-security investment.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we contex-
tualize this research by emphasizing the evolution of cyber-threats monitoring
approaches and their potential disruptive technologies. In Section 3, we present
an extension of the GL model and we provide related propositions in order to
create room for capturing the consequences of disruptive technologies on cyber-
security investment. In Section 4, we suggest that our framework can be applied
by critical-infrastructure providers (CIP) in order to help them optimize their
investment in IS defense technologies. In the last section, we discuss limitations
and future work.

2 Cyber-Threat Monitoring Approaches

Cyber-threat monitoring approaches can be divided in two broad classes: (1)
targeted event-based detection and (2) behavior-anomaly detection [2,39]. Both
approaches aim to detect suspicious events (i.e., related to security concerns
such as data breaches) through IDS [39]. However, technologies related to (2) are
rapidly evolving and could disrupt the cyber-security market and the investment
in these technologies.

3 In this article, the term big data refers to data whose complexity impedes it from
being processed (mined, stored, queried and analyzed) through conventional data-
processing technologies [27]. The complexity of big data is deÔ¨Åned by three attributes:
(1) the volume (terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes (1018 bytes); (2) the velocity
(referring to the fast-paced data generation); and (3) the variety (referring to the
combination of structured and unstructured data) [27]. The Ô¨Åeld of BDA is related
to the extraction of value from big data ‚Äì i.e., insights that are non-trivial, previously
unknown, implicit and potentially useful. BDA extracts patterns of actions, occur-
rences, and behaviors from big data by Ô¨Åtting statistical models to these patterns
through diÔ¨Äerent data-mining techniques (e.g., predictive analytics, cluster analysis,
association-rule mining, and prescriptive analytics) [35,14].

2.1 The Targeted Event-Based Detection Approach

For the past three decades, scholars, practitioners, and organizations have been
developing numerous conventional technical means to increase cyber-security by
using signature-detection measures and encryption techniques [7,6]. However,
the success of such conventional approaches has been limited [16,7,6,12].

The targeted event-based detection approach essentially relies on signature-
detection measures in which an identiÔ¨Åer is attributed to a known threat4 (i.e.,
a threat that had been witnessed in the past), so that this threat can be sub-
sequently identiÔ¨Åed [7,39,2]. Examples of targeted event-based detection include
network-IDS, access-control mechanisms, Ô¨Årewalls and pattern-based antivirus
engines [2,39,7]. For instance, a signature-detection technology such as an anti-
virus scanner might detect a unique pre-established pattern of code that is con-
tained in a Ô¨Åle. If that speciÔ¨Åc pattern (i.e., signature) is discovered, the Ô¨Åle will
be Ô¨Çagged in order to warn the end-user that their Ô¨Åle is infected. [7]. Yet, such
an approach is becoming more and more ineÔ¨Äective, as the swift evolution of
cyber-threats is becoming more sophisticated [7,2,45,15]. Over the last decade,
cyber-crimes have rapidly increased because hackers have developed new proce-
dures to circumvent IS security to gain unauthorized and illegal access to the
system. For instance, as malware spread from one system to the next, hackers
employ polymorphic code 5 techniques in order to (automatically) rapidly modify
the pattern [19], thus evading and circumventing existing detection mechanisms.6
Consequently, such a targeted event-based detection would be ineÔ¨Äective because
of the lag that exists between the development of signatures and the rapid ex-
pansion of cyber-threats. Moreover, zero-day 7 vulnerabilities cannot be caught
with such an approach.

Therefore, an important limiting factor of the targeted event-based detection
approach is that it is intrinsically reactive in nature [7,2]. Attributing a signa-
ture to a cyber-threat is always preceded by a cyber-incident, which implies that
signatures are unable to identify unknown and/or emerging threats. As a con-
sequence, signature-detection measures can be rendered almost ineÔ¨Äective by
hackers [45,15]. Such a scenario is even ampliÔ¨Åed in the era of extended digi-
tization and big data [39]. The reasons are that (1) the swift development of

4 Common cyber-risks include malware (spyware, ransomware, viruses, worms, etc.),
phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks (MitM), (distributed) denial-of-service attacks
((D)DoS), malicious SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), credential reuse, and
brute-force attacks.

5 A polymorphic code is a code that employs a polymorphic engine in order to mutate
while keeping the original algorithm intact. In other terms, the code changes itself
each time it runs, but its semantics ‚Äì the function of the code ‚Äì will not change [19].
6 Additional techniques such as, sandbox resistance, fast Ô¨Çuxing, adversarial reverse
engineering, social-engineering attacks, spooÔ¨Ång, and advanced persistent threats
(APT) are continuously evolving and spreading [2].

7 A zero-day vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is either unknown
to or unaddressed by operators who should be interested in mitigating the vulner-
ability. Zero-day vulnerabilities enable hackers to exploit it in order to adversely
aÔ¨Äect computer programs, networks, and data [25].

computer networks (e.g., the extensive use of cloud and mobile computing) in
the past decades generated new channels that expose data to cyber-attack, thus
increasing the pool of systems to be attacked hence amplifying numerous se-
curity issues related to intrusions on computer and network systems [39]; (2),
up to multiple exabytes of information are being transferred daily, usually im-
peding the process of the entire set of security information, e.g., network logs,
access records, etc.; (3) the velocity of data generation makes any type of data
processing diÔ¨Écult through conventional computer hardware and software ar-
chitectures; (4) the complexity of data also impedes security information from
being processed by conventional computers, e.g., data come from diverse sources,
it is stored in diÔ¨Äerent formats and on diÔ¨Äerent IT. Hence, the damage done by
cyber-threats could be identiÔ¨Åed only after an attack, giving hackers more eÔ¨É-
cient possibilities to access networks, to hide their presence and to inÔ¨Çict damage
[16].

2.2 The Behavior-Anomaly Detection Approach

In order to address the drawbacks of the targeted event-based detection ap-
proach, research & development has been focused on a behavior-anomaly de-
tection approach [16,39,34,18,15,43,45]. Such an approach aims to detect sus-
picious/unusual events through the extraction of patterns, by using behavior
anomalies and/or deviations from behaviors (actions, occurrences) of entities
and/or users of a network, rather than patterns of code as in the case of the tar-
geted event-based detection [16,39,34,18,15,43,45]. The targeted event-based de-
tection approach is predominantly based on security analytics 8 and aims to pro-
vide dynamic detection of cyber-threats through techniques derived from BDA
by Ô¨Åtting statistical models on these patterns through diÔ¨Äerent techniques (e.g.,
predictive analytics, cluster analysis, association-rule mining, and prescriptive
analytics) [35,14] used for network forensics, traÔ¨Éc clustering and alert correla-
tion [2]. Some examples have been developed by [43,18,34].

Complementing the targeted event-based detection approach by using signature-

detection measures, such a behavior-anomaly detection approach is envisioned
to foster cyber-threats monitoring by increasing its productivity [16]. Exam-
ples of security analytics applications are the development of security infor-
mation and event management (SIEM). SIEM products and services combine
security-information management (SIM) and security-event management (SEM)
[11]. SIEM provide real-time analysis of information-security alerts generated by
applications and network hardware. SIEM are sold as managed services, as soft-
ware, or as appliances [11]. These products and services are also used to log secu-
rity data and to generate reports for compliance purposes. SIEM products and

terns related to behavioral anomalies and/or deviations from behaviors (actions,
occurrences) of entities and/or users of a network. In other words, security analytics
methods aim to distinguish patterns generated by legitimate users from patterns
generated by suspicious and/or malicious users [16].

services are widely used within information-security operation centers (ISOC) ‚Äì
also called fusion centers ‚Äì of organizations. The open-threat exchange platform
called AlienVault OTX is an example of SIEM products and services.9

Cyber-security technologies related to the behavior-anomaly detection ap-
proach ‚Äì and more precisely related to security analytics ‚Äì are susceptible to
disrupting the cyber-security market [45,43,18,34]. However, the dynamic (i.e.,
time related) consequences of such disruptive technologies on cyber-security in-
vestment cannot be analyzed through the existing GL model and its extensions.
They rely on restrictive assumptions that are not adapted for analyzing dy-
namic aspects of cyber-security investment [20]. Consequently, a supplementary
extension of the GL model is necessary.

3 Extending the Gordon-Loeb Model

By focusing on costs and beneÔ¨Åts associated with cyber-security, the GL model
states that each organization‚Äôs objective is to maximize its expected net-beneÔ¨Åts
in cyber-security function (ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ) [20]. This corresponds to minimizing the to-
tal expected cost, equivalent to the addition of the expected loss10 (ùë£ùêø) due to
cyber-security breaches and the expenses (ùëß) in cyber-security processes, prod-
ucts and/or services implemented and/or undertaken in order to counter such
breaches [22,20]. Figure 1 on page 7 illustrates the maximization of the expected
beneÔ¨Åts coming from cyber-security expenditures (ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ).11

In Section 2, we emphasized that the advent of the behavior-anomaly detec-
tion approach ‚Äì triggered by security analytics and its use of BDA ‚Äì is bringing
to the fore new cyber-security technologies that have the potential to disrupt
the cyber-security market [45,43,18,34,35] by hypothetically bringing superior
returns on investment vis-`a-vis conventional measures related to the targeted
event-based detection approach [35]. As a consequence, the ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ function might
shift to the left. Figure 2 on page 8 illustrates the potential maximization of the
ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ function in the context of BDA. Accordingly:

Proposition 1: If BDA is employed in order to provide cyber-threats
monitoring, the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ function will shift to the left due to a greater
productivity of BDA compared to conventional technologies.

Consequently, the optimal level of cyber-security investment will decrease from
ùëß‚àó to ùëß‚àó
ùëë (c.f.: Figure 2 on page 8). For the same level of protection, investment
in cyber-security will decrease ‚Äì ceteris paribus. Accordingly:

that a threat, once realized (i.e., an attack), would be successful ‚Äì to cyber-security
breaches, (P); and ùêø is the potential loss associated with the security breach, ($).
The model description and its assumptions were explained in detail by [22,20].
11 In order to simplify the illustration, Ô¨Ågures 1, 2 and 3 on pages 7 and 9 depicts the
ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ function instead of the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ function. The ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ function is obtained by
subtracting the investment (ùëß) to the ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ function.

Proposition 2: If BDA is implemented in order to provide cyber-threats
monitoring, the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ function will witness a discontinuity in its do-
main ùëç due to a greater productivity of BDA compared to conventional
technologies.

Notes to Figure 1: The original function of the expected beneÔ¨Åts in cyber-security
(ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ0 (ùëß)) has a do- main ùëç that yields a distribution between zero and the mon-
etary value of the expected loss (ùë£ùêø) in the absence of any cyber-security investment.
The monetary value (i.e., costs) of the investment (ùëß), corresponds to the 45¬∞ line. The
optimal level of cyber-security investment (ùëß‚àó) is obtained when the diÔ¨Äerence between
beneÔ¨Åts and costs is maximized (tangent to ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ0 (ùëß) ‚Äì where the marginal beneÔ¨Åts
are equivalent to the marginal cost of one ‚Äì yielding a slope of 45¬∞, in blue). N.B.: the
optimal level of cyber-security investment (ùëß‚àó) is smaller than the expected loss (ùë£ùêø)
in the absence of any investment.

Notes to Figure 2: The new function of the expected beneÔ¨Åts in cyber-security
(ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜùëë (ùëß)) has also a do- main ùëç that yields a distribution between zero and the
monetary value of the expected loss (ùë£ùêø) in the absence of any cyber-security invest-
ment. The monetary value (i.e., costs) of the investment (ùëß), also cor- responds to
the 45¬∞ line. Similarly to Figure 1, the optimal level of cyber-security investment (ùëß‚àó
ùëë)
is obtained when the diÔ¨Äerence between beneÔ¨Åts and costs is maximized (tangent to
ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜùëë (ùëß), yielding a slope of 45¬∞, in green). Yet, due to the left shift of the ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ
function (from ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ0 (ùëß) to ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜùëë (ùëß)), the optimal level of cyber-security investment
also shifts from ùëß‚àó to ùëß‚àó
ùëë.

Figure 3 on page 9 illustrates such a discontinuity in the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ function de-
scribed in Proposition 2. Yet, as the implementation of a disruptive technology
implicitly triggers a productivity diÔ¨Äerential over time, we propose to extend the
GL model in two distinct but related ways.

3.1 A Temporal Setup

First, in order to capture the advent of a disruptive technology and its dynamic
consequences on cyber-security investment, a temporal setup has to be imple-
mented. As the GL model was developed for a single-period, it excludes the
fundamental temporal dimension for analyzing the technological-shift dynamics
induced by eÔ¨Éciency improvements. Hence, the extension of the original single-
period model to a multi-period12 setup might bring signiÔ¨Åcant insight in under-

time should be considered as continuous or discrete [37], in our proposed extension of

Notes to Figure 3: In this graph, the horizontal axis represents both investment (ùëß)
and time (ùë°). The red line represents the function of the expected beneÔ¨Åts in cyber-
security over time (ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜùëöùëñ ùë• (ùëß)). The red dashed line represents the discontinuity in
the domain ùëç of the ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜùëöùëñ ùë• (ùëß) function ‚Äì due to the implementation of a disruptive
technology at time ùë°1. Without the implementation of a disruptive technology, the
function of the expected beneÔ¨Åts in cyber-security remains ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜ0 (ùëß) (in blue). With
the implementation of a disruptive technology from ùë° = 0, the function of the expected
beneÔ¨Åts in cyber-security is ùê∏ ùêµùêºùëÜùëë (ùëß) (in green). The optimal level of cyber-security

standing the dynamic aspects of cyber-security investment that were originally
evaded.

SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we adapt the GL model from [20], such as the maximization of
the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ function is determined by an antidiÔ¨Äerence operator of this same
function, which has the domain ùëç ‚äÜ R‚â•0 (representing the set of investment
possibilities, ùëßùëñ) at the end of the speciÔ¨Åed time horizon ùëá ‚äÜ N, wherein each
period ùëñ ‚àà [1, ùëõ]. This yields:

the GL model, we consider time as discrete. Such a choice is determined by the fact
that any further empirical research that would test our extension will be essentially
conditioned by measuring time as a discrete variable. Consequently, the following
extension is based on an antidiÔ¨Äerence instead of an antiderivative.

3.2 A Discontinuity in the Security-Breach Probability Function

Second, the presumed technological shift induced by the superior productivity
of a disruptive technology challenges the assumption of a continuously twice-
diÔ¨Äerentiable security-breach probability function. The original model deÔ¨Ånes
continuously decreasing but positive returns to scale of cyber-security invest-
ment. Yet, this continuously twice-diÔ¨Äerentiable setup leaves no room for a dis-
crete emergence of a technological shift brought by a disruptive and more eÔ¨Écient
technology.14 In such a theoretical framework, the elasticity of the protection of
cyber-security processes, products and/or services evades radical technological
progress. However, technological progress induced by the implementation of a
disruptive technology ‚Äì such as BDA ‚Äì could considerably reduce cyber-security
investment by bringing suggestively greater returns on investment.15

13 In the original GL model [20], the organization‚Äôs inherent vulnerability is deÔ¨Åned as
the probability that a threat, once realized (i.e., an attack), would be successful.
14 [20] explicitly acknowledge that they ‚Äòabstract from reality and assume that pos-
tulated functions are suÔ¨Éciently smooth and well behaved‚Äô, thus creating favorable
conditions for applying basic diÔ¨Äerential calculus, hence simplifying the optimization
problem of the security-investment phenomenon. Although a smooth approximation
of the security-investment phenomenon done by [20] is a reasonable Ô¨Årst approach,
in order to deliver insight concerning the problem of determining an optimal level of
cyber-security investment, such an approach lacks realism. As explicitly mentioned
by [20]: [...] ‚Äòin reality, discrete investment in new security technologies are often
necessary to get incremental result. Such a discrete investment results in discontinu-
ities.‚Äô

15 In BDA, an extremely large, fast paced and complex amount of information can be
processed in signiÔ¨Åcantly shortened time frames and at almost zero marginal cost
per additional unit of information ‚Äì once the Ô¨Åxed development and implementa-
tion costs of systems and algorithms for investigating threat patterns are invested
[41]. Furthermore, the real-time analytics provided by big-data algorithms are likely

The investor realizes a Pareto improvement by either obtaining a higher
level of protection for the same investment or by obtaining the same level of
protection at a lower cost; because fewer resources, such as time and human
labor, can be largely substituted by algorithms, and automation might be used.
As a result, with the implementation of BDA, cyber-security investment might
be signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced by disruption: BDA would introduce a discontinuity in
the security-breach probability function, hence modifying the original GL model
assumption of continuity. Accordingly, adapting the security-breach probabil-
ity function (ùëÜùêº ) from [20], we propose the following security-breach probability
function (ùëÜùêº (cid:48)
ùëñ ) in order to capture the advent of a disruptive technology by in-
troducing discountinuity through the parameter ùëëùëñ:

ùëÜùêº (cid:48)

text is necessary in order to exemplify and demonstrate their relevancy, and to

to neutralize any attacker‚Äôs information advantage, such that the probability of a
cyber-breach should be reduced. For example, an attacker can exploit zero-day vul-
nerabilities by knowing where to attack, whereas the defender does not know, hence
has to protect all potential entry spots. As real-time analytics reveals both the time
and the position of the attack as it happens, the defender can react precisely on the
attacked spot, thus save any unnecessary investment in the protection of spots that
are not attacked.

4 Application for CIPs

A cyber-security breach inÔ¨Çicted on a critical infrastructure (CI) generates mas-
sive negative externalities, especially due to the increasing interdependency and
to technical interconnectedness of diÔ¨Äerent CIs [22,1]. As a result, cyber-security
issues are the main challenge for CIP [5]. Therefore, the issue of cyber-security
investment becomes highly relevant in the context of CIs, and especially so from
a social-welfare perspective [22].

In this respect, cyber-security investment is a national security priority for
the great majority of governments (e.g., [32]). For example, on February 12,
2013, the administration of US President Barack Obama implemented Exec-
utive Order 13636 [31] named Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.
This executive order stated that ‚ÄòThe national and economic security of the
United States depends on the reliable functioning of the Nation‚Äôs critical infras-
tructure in the face of such threats. It is the policy of the United States to enhance
the security and resilience of the Nation‚Äôs critical infrastructure and to main-
tain a cyber-environment that encourages eÔ¨Éciency, innovation, and economic
prosperity while promoting safety, security, business conÔ¨Ådentiality, privacy, and
civil liberties‚Äô [31]. Following this trend, on May 11, 2017, the administration of
US President Donald Trump implemented Executive Order 13800 [44], named
Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure.
This executive order stated that ‚ÄòEÔ¨Äective immediately, each agency head shall
use ‚ÄòThe Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity‚Äô devel-
oped by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or any successor
document, to manage the agency‚Äôs cyber-security risk. Each agency head shall
provide a risk management report to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the
Director of the OÔ¨Éce of Management and Budget within 90 days of the date of
this order ‚Äô [44].

We believe that our suggested extension of the GL model should be general-
izable across any kind of cyber-security concerns, yet we illustrate our approach
in the context of CIP as security-cost reduction related to risk events are of prior
importance because potential losses reach unaÔ¨Äordable dimensions [22]. Despite
the fact that BDA is considered a promising method for CIP, its concrete impli-
cations have not been discussed much.

More speciÔ¨Åcally, our extension of the GL model provides a theoretical frame-
work for analyzing the impact of the implementation of any given novel technol-
ogy on cyber-security investment over time. In this respect, by subtracting antid-
iÔ¨Äerence operators of ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ, Œî‚àí1ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ(ùëßùëñ), at two diÔ¨Äerent speciÔ¨Åed time-span
of same duration, (ùê¥ ‚àí ùêµ), a potential decrease in cyber-security investment, Œîùëç ,
can be analyzed ‚Äì ceteris paribus:

Œîùëç = (cid:8)Œî‚àí1ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ(ùëß ùê¥)(cid:9) ‚àí (cid:8)Œî‚àí1ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ(ùëßùêµ)(cid:9)

where ùêµ ‚äÜ N is a time-span, wherein each period ùëñùêµ ‚àà [ùëõ, ùë°], and in
which a given novel technology is implemented; whereas ùê¥ ‚äÜ N is a time-

ùëñ=ùëõ ùëñ and (cid:205)ùëö

and ùêµ ‚Äì except for the domains ùëç, wherein ùëç ùê¥ ‚â† ùëçùêµ ‚Äì, an organization can
determine if any given novel technology generates a greater ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ. If it is the
case, the organization might consider the novel technology implemented in ùêµ
as disruptive; inversely, if the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ does not substantially changes, the im-
plemented novel technology cannot be considered as disruptive. Note that even
though equation 6 can be used for analyzing the diÔ¨Äerential in cyber-security
investment between two time-spans, equation 3 remains necessary in order to
determine the optimal level of cyber-security investment (ùëßùëñ) through the maxi-
mization of the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ(ùëßùëñ) function.

The application of our GL model extension to the context of CIP should
provide us with a relevant and seminal basis on which our arguments can be
formally modeled and simulated. In the case of human-processed information and
defense tactics, these issues would probably make the optimal level of protection
diÔ¨Écult to attain or even impossible to Ô¨Ånance, as the expected loss would be
extreme in the case of cascading failures of CIs; hence the resulting cyber-security
investment would also have to reach extreme levels. However, with the eÔ¨Äects
that the BDA technology (or any similar disruptive technology) could have on
investment in cyber-security, the investment needs by CIP could remain at the
same level or even decrease, as these novel threats are neutralized by the superior
technology that BDA oÔ¨Äers.

5 Discussion

In this last section, we present our concluding comments, the policy recommen-
dations resulting from concluding comments, we discuss the limitations of this
study and suggest paths for further research.

5.1 Concluding Comments

In this article, we propose an extension of the GL model by adapting its initial
theoretical framework in order to capture time-related insights related to the
consequences that a disruptive technology can have on cyber-security investment.
We propose two important contributions. First, we argue that a single-period
model is not adapted to capture dynamic aspects of cyber-security investment
such as the advent of a disruptive technology. The extension to a multi-period
model is indeed necessary. Second, in the context of the introduction of a discrete
disruptive cyber-security technology, the security-breach probability function of
the original GL model could not be considered as continuously diÔ¨Äerentiable.
These two arguments enrich the initial model by giving supplementary insight on
cyber-security investment. Through our extended ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ function, our proposed
revision of the GL model captures both the Ô¨Ånancial consequences on the optimal
level of investment and the security productivity of the advent of any given novel
(and potentially disruptive) technology. Although we believe that this reasoning
is generalizable across a wide range of cyber-security concerns, we illustrate
our approach in the context of CIP, for which cyber-security breaches inÔ¨Çict
unaÔ¨Äordable social costs that urgently need to be reduced.

5.2 Considerations for Policy Recommendations

First and foremost, our extension of the GL model is intended to be used for de-
termining the optimal level of cyber-security investment through the maximiza-
tion of the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ(ùëßùëñ) function. The optimal level of cyber-security investment
is obtained when the diÔ¨Äerence between beneÔ¨Åts and costs are maximized ‚Äì i.e.,
where the marginal beneÔ¨Åts of cyber-security investment are equivalent to the
marginal cost of potential losses due to cyber-security threats.

Also, our extension of the GL model provides a theoretical framework in
order to analyze the expected net-beneÔ¨Åts of the implementation of any given
novel technology over time. By subtracting antidiÔ¨Äerence operators of ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ
at two diÔ¨Äerent speciÔ¨Åed time-spans, and by controlling for every parameters
to remain equal between two time-spans (except for investment), a potential
decrease in cyber-security investment can be analyzed. Throughout our model,
an organization can determine if any given novel technology generates a greater
ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ. If it is the case, the organization might consider the novel technology im-
plemented as disruptive; inversely, if the ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ does not substantially changes,
the implemented novel technology cannot be considered as disruptive.

We presented a dynamic analysis for determining the optimal investment
level for IS defense, in the context of potentially disruptive technologies. By con-
ceptualizing a security-breach probability function that includes productivity
parameters (ùõº and ùõΩ) of a given cyber-security technology, practitioners can cal-
culate the optimal level of investment in IS defense processes, products and/or
services, and also select them according to the highest productivity parameters.
Although this work remains theoretical, it gives a systematic method for optimiz-
ing IS defense investment in the context of potentially disruptive technologies.

5.3 Limitations and Paths for Further Research

Finally, our research design ‚Äì based on theoretical modeling and utility maxi-
mization ‚Äì has some limitations that future research could help relax.

First, the productivity parameters (ùõºùëñ and ùõΩùëñ) of a given cyber-security tech-
nology are theoretically conceptualized, but not empirically measured. Such an
eÔ¨Äort could add a substantive beneÔ¨Åts in terms of validation/refutation of our
propositions. However, researchers might Ô¨Ånd it diÔ¨Écult to gain access to data
as they are substantially diÔ¨Écult to measure and/or to Ô¨Ånd [30]. A possible so-
lution in order to measure these productivity parameters could be derived from
equation 6, by computing the ratio between ùëçùêµ and ùëç ùê¥. By doing so, a relative
measure of productivity between a technology employed in Œî‚àí1ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ(ùëß ùê¥) and
a technology employed in Œî‚àí1ùê∏ ùëÅ ùêµùêºùëÜ(ùëßùêµ) could be extracted.

Second, the term disruptive technologies [17] has been qualitatively deÔ¨Åned,
but not quantitatively delimited. Such a research eÔ¨Äort is necessary in order
to delimit the dummy variable ùëëùëñ (that takes the value 0 when no disruptive
technology is used, and 1 otherwise). Again, such a quantitative delimitation
could be drawn by determining a threshold value in the aforementioned ratio
between ùëçùêµ and ùëç ùê¥.

Third, and consequently, this article formally modeled an extension to the GL
model, but it did not simulate or empirically test our suggested extension. We
decided to leave this operationalization to future research as we wanted to focus
on the generalizability of the model. Any simulation or empirical operational-
ization requires a speciÔ¨Åcation of the above-mentioned productivity parameters
ùõºùëñ and ùõΩùëñ of each technology considered for investment, as well as the speciÔ¨Åca-
tion of the dummy variable ùëëùëñ for classifying which technologies are considered
disruptive (and when). Such choices make the model more speciÔ¨Åc to particular
assumptions about technological and productivity contexts. Hence, we suggest
that our model should be operationalized by a series of diÔ¨Äerent simulations and
empirical tests, rather than by one illustrative simulation run. Given the fact
that speciÔ¨Åcations of such simulations and/or empirical tests would require mul-
tiple cases and thus multiple contexts (and thus multiple articles). Nevertheless,
we recommend that future research simulates, tests and develops further the
model we proposed here.

Fourth, the security-breach probability function ùëÜùêº (cid:48)

ùëñ that we employed in this
work can be replaced by many other families of more complex functions. In this
research, we selected the Ô¨Årst family of security-breach probability function pro-
posed by [20], namely ùëÜùêº . However, in reality, adding more families of functions
could enrich the analysis (e.g., [28]).

Once the aforementioned points are deÔ¨Åned by empirical analyzes and Ô¨Åeld sur-
veys, further research could propose to simulate a multi-player and multi-period
game (e.g., [23]) that models the cyber-security for CIP in the era of disruptive
technologies. Such research ‚Äì by collecting simulated data and quantitatively
analyzing them ‚Äì would contribute to complement the theoretical approach pre-
sented in this article, hence test the intuition of our theoretical development.
