Cyber-attack Mitigation and Impact Analysis 
for Low-power IoT Devices 

Ashutosh Bandekar, Ahmad Y Javaid*, Member IEEE

Abstract— Recent years have seen exponential development in 
wireless  sensor  devices  and  their  rebirth  as  IoT,  as  well  as 
increased popularity in wireless home devices such as bulbs, fans, 
and  microwave.  As  they  can  be  used  in  various  fields  such  as 
medical  devices,  environmental  studies,  fire  department  or 
military  application,  etc.,  security  of  these  low  powered  devices 
will always be a concern for all the user and security experts. Users 
nowadays want to control all these “smart” wireless home devices 
through their smartphones using an internet connection. Attacks 
such as distributed attacks on these devices will render the whole 
system  vulnerable  as  these  attacks  can  record  and  extract 
confidential  information  as  well  as  increase  resource  (energy) 
consumption  of  the  entire  network.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  a 
cyber-attack detection algorithm and present an impact analysis 
of easy-to-launch cyber-attacks on a low-power mote (Z1 Zolertia) 
as a model IoT device. We also present detailed results of power 
consumption analysis with and without attack along with when the 
mitigation algorithm for intrusion detection is implemented. 

Keywords—  IoT  network  security,  Cyber-attack  mitigation,

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  devices  provide  users  several 
advantages including being easy to use, compact and wireless in 
connectivity.  These  devices  comprise  of  sensors  such  as 
temperature,  humidity,  and  sound,  and  are  usually  part  of  a 
network allowing it to be controlled through a centralized device 
such as a smartphone or a PC. Zolertia Z1, Sky Mote, and T-
mote are a few examples of wireless sensor network devices of 
the first generation. The newer generation of these devices, most 
commonly known as IoT devices, are packaged as easy to use 
devices for use as smart homes devices. Also, companies such 
Amazon  has  dash  buttons  which  are  equipped  with  these  IoT 
devices [1]. As these devices are compact and provide user to 
control  through  easily  accessible  mobile  devices,  they  have  a 
wide variety of applications such as health monitoring systems, 
hands-free household device control, and military applications. 

However,  according  to  some  studies,  70  percent  of  these 
devices have many vulnerabilities [2]. We are using Zolertia Z1 
in our experiment as this device works on the same principle as 
the newer generation of IoT devices works. As these devices are 
low-powered  and  have  limited  computational  capabilities,  the 
impact  of  attacks  such  as  wormhole  or  flooding  will  have  a 
disastrous effect on the entire network. To prevent these attacks, 
there is a need of a power efficient intrusion detection system 
(IDS). Such an IDS can monitor the whole network constantly 
for malicious activity or violation as a result of an intrusion. IDS 
can either be an additional hardware or an algorithm. If IDS is 
in the form of hardware, then there is a risk of increased power 
consumption within the IoT network. Recently, there has been 

numerous  cases  of  huge  DDoS  attacks  using  millions  of  IoT 
devices  [3].  In  the  specifically  cited  case,  millions  of  IoT 
devices, packaged with an insecure operating system, were used 
to  send  requests  to  a  DNS  provider  called  Dyn,  leading  to 
disruption  in  services  of  providers  like  Netflix,  CNN,  and 
Twitter [4]. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that manufacturers have not 
been paying much attention to the security of these IoT devices 
while  focusing  on  fast-track  development,  marketing  and 
delivery to the market. This also necessitates the development 
of a secure communication algorithm for IoT devices which can 
be directly used on any of these IoT devices irrespective of their 
manufacturer  to  protect  organizations  as  well  as  individuals 
using them for their smart homes. 

A.  Contributions 

Considering  these  limitations  and  requirements,  there  is  a 
need for an algorithm that will provide security and overcome 
resource limitations. Such a secure message passing technique 
should be designed for these low powered devices along with 
cyber-attack  detection.  Clearly,  implementing  various  secure 
cryptographic  protocols  on  these  devices  will  increase  the 
consumption  of  resources  on  these  IoT  devices.  This  paper 
proposes a novel algorithm that is employed within Zolertia Z1 
motes  to  test  the  efficiency  of  the  algorithm  in  terms  of 
enhancing security and reducing power consumption, as these 
devices work on the same principle as the newer generation of 
IoT devices. After result validation, we can implement the same 
algorithm on other popular IoT devices. 

B.  Paper outline 

The next section discusses related work in the domain and 
includes some of the existing implementations. In section III, the 
information  about  the  technology  used  such  as  hardware, 
software, and environment selected for the experimental setup 
are  discussed.  Most  importantly  brief  information  about  the 
implemented algorithm. Section IV presents various simulation 
and experimental results along with their comparative analysis. 
Finally, we conclude the paper in section V. 

II.  RELATED WORK 

In this paper, we are discussing and proposing a novel cyber-
attack  mitigation  technique  for  IoT  device  networks.  The 
analysis  conducted  considers  the  impact  of  cyber-attacks  and 
deployment of the IDS algorithm on the network comprising of 
IoT  devices.  In  a  previous  work,  a  comparative  analysis  of 
energy consumption and battery life estimation for similar IoT 
devices was presented [5]. Similar experiment pattern is being 
followed in this paper to validate our algorithm. However, in this 
paper,  the  efficiency  of  the  proposed  security  algorithm  is 

 
 
 
discussed, and a comparison has been presented of the results 
after conducting the same experiment in enclosed lab space with 
and without IDS with an ongoing cyber attack. Most works in 
the area of energy consumption analysis  with ongoing attacks 
and  implemented  IDS  use  simulation  rather  than  real-world 
motes. However, a study deals with real world experiments with 
a Z1 and Open motes [6]. On the contrary, this work does not 
target security or analyzes the behavior of motes when a security 
algorithm is implemented. There is one security based work, but 
it  is  also  limited  in  its  analysis  due  to  its  nature  of  being 
simulation based [7]. 

As  w  are  considering  IoT  devices  constrained  energy 
resources  will  always  be  an  important  aspect.  There  is  an 
investigative  study  regarding  performance  measurements  [8], 
energy  consumption  and  computation  point  of  view  with  the 
help of MICAz and TelosB sensors after the implementation of 
Elliptical curve cryptography One more similar study has been 
conducted considering all Mica wireless sensor network devices 
and TelosB sensors [9] but these devices have more computing 
features  compared  to  Zolertia  Z1  as  it  is  very  low  powered 
devices consisting very limited. Also in one of the studies, there 
is  a proposed  lightweight  encryption  for IoT devices. [10] As 
these devices have many security issues if they are being used 
in  healthcare  application  systems  such  as  Wireless  body  area 
network. [11] If the power consumption of these IoT devices is 
considered, then there are many studies but out of them a survey 
of the  wireless  sensor  network  power consumption is  present, 
but it has been conducted in a simulation environment. [12] 

However,  in  this  paper,  the  efficiency  of  the  proposed 
security  algorithm  is  discussed,  and  a  comparison  has  been 
presented of the results after conducting the same experiment in 
enclosed lab space with and without IDS with an ongoing cyber 
attack. Most works in the area of energy consumption analysis 
with ongoing attacks. In the next section, there will be a detailed 
description  of  our  technological  approach  towards  conducting 
the experiments. 

III.  TECHNICAL APPROACH 

As  we are conducting an impact analysis of cyber-attack 
and cyber-attack mitigation for low-power IoT devices, we are 
using Zolertia Z1 motes as our testing platform. 

A.  Hardware 

These devices use the second-generation MSP430, a low 
powered 16-bit MCU operating at 16 MHz. It has the  micro-
USB connector  for power and debugging. It is also equipped 
with  the  CC2420  transceiver  that  operates  at  2.4GHz  and  is 
compliant with IEEE 802.15.4, 6LowPAN, ZigBee protocols. 
It  also  comprises  of  other  sensors  such  as  3-Axis  gyroscope, 
±2/4/8/16  g  digital  accelerometer  (ADXL345),  and  digital 
temperature  sensor  (TMP102)  with  ±  0.5ºC  accuracy  [13]. 
These devices work in the range of 0.3-3.6V, and it can even 
operate on two 1.5V AA batteries [5] and code size as these IoT 
devices  have  limited  memory.  This  OS  requires  kernel, 
libraries, the program loader and a set of processes and supports 
C programming language. [13] 

Figure 1. Topology used for the Z1 motes in real-world experiments 

B.  Environment 

 We are analyzing the impact of cyber-attack and proposed 
IDS  by  changing  different  operating  conditions  such  as 
basketball court, auditorium, open parking lot, and working lab 
space  as  well  as  in  various  lighting  conditions.  During 
simulation, we followed the same topology, i.e., eight motes in 
a  grid  of  15ft  x  5ft  and  repeated  the  same  procedure  except 
changing the operating environment. Cooja simulation platform 
has  limited  support  in  terms  of  simulation  in  a  different 
environment [14].  

C.  Experimental Setup 

the  broadcast  and  one 

 For experimental setup, we created testbed of nine motes 
and out of nine, we used eight motes to create a grid of 15ft x 
5ft  on  which  we  ran 
to  one 
communication programs. The ninth mote collected the power 
consumption  data  using  the  powertrace  code  in  different 
operating  and  lighting  conditions  [5]  [15].  This  process  was 
followed to observe the behavior of network when there is no 
attack. Then we echoed the same procedure by converting one 
of  the  motes  from  the  grid  to  the  attacker  and  again  the 
congruent methodology by implementing our proposed IDS in 
one  of  the  eight  motes.  From  figure  1,  we  can  observe  the 
topology used for real world mote experiments.  To validate the 
results from the real-world mote experiments, we also analyze 
the impact on simulation using Cooja.  

D.  Software 

As discussed in the previous section we considered Contiki 
OS for the provision of Zolertia Z1 drivers. Contiki OS is very 
efficient  OS  for  low-powered  devices  such  as  Z1  mote,  Sky 
mote, etc. For running Contiki OS require kernel, libraries, the 
program loader and the set of processes [15]. This OS supports 
C  programming  language,  and  it  can  run  platforms  such  as 
MSP430 [14] [16]. Contiki OS is capable of implementing any 
topology according. 

 From figure 2, we can compare the protocols followed by 
IoT and regular IP network. In the figure,  we can notice  that 
after the presentation of the layer representation of the regular 
network stack is there and after that protocols followed by IoT 
devices and implementation of the Contiki layer.

Figure 4.  Architecture of the Attack mitigation algorithm 

The  physical  layer  parameters  used  for  key  generation 
include  RSSI,  location,  and  other  channel  parameters.  In  the 
figure we can observe the architecture we are proposing.  We 
can notice that we are connecting all the nodes to the internet 
with the help of IPv6 protocol and during the implementation, 
we are considering all the  key  generation, neighboring  nodes 
monitoring,  RSSI  collection  and  monitoring    and  attack 
detection.  

Figure  4  we  can  notice  the  general  architecture  of  the 
implemented intrusion detection system. It has one anchor node 
to  collect,  determine  the  neighboring  node  information.  This 
architecture follows the following steps:  

a.  Determining  the  distance  between  each  node  in  the 

network 

b.  Collecting  the  information  regarding  the  neighboring 
node(s)  such  as  the  distance  of  the  neighboring  nodes 
from the anchor nodes. 

c.  If the neighboring in not in the range of the anchor node 

then 
i.  Generate alert  

Fig 3. Topology used in simulation 

We followed the  same topology as  we can observe from 
the  figure  3,  with  which  we  ran  simulation  without  any 
proposed implementation with the help of nine motes. We can 
observe the topology used in simulation in the figure. On eight 
out  of  nine  motes  we  ran  Broadcast  and  Unicast  and  on 
remaining one powertrace example. Then in simulation, also we 
employed  our  proposed  implementation  following  the  same 
pattern.  

E.  Attack Mitigation Algorithm 

To mitigate cyber-attacks, an IDS that will monitor the IoT 
network and detect attacks is required. To mitigate the attack 
and secure the network from intrusions, the proposed technique 
combines  physical  layer  parameter  based  key  generation  for 
cryptography with packet encapsulation. The algorithm detects 
several  types  of  intrusions  as  per  our  experiments  with 
wormhole and Sybil attacks.

While detecting the attacker node, we can even track the 
node location as this algorithm is based on node localization. 
Following the algorithm implemented. As we can see that we 
have to follow every other step mentioned above.   

 The  implemented  algorithm  is  modified  version  of  the 
existing  IDS  which  was  designed  for  wormhole  attack 
considering  the  low  powered  devices  or  IoT  devices  such  as 
Zolertia Z1. As we are analyzing the impact of implementation 
of intrusion detection system as these implementations should 
be  efficient  considering  resource  consumption.  After  the 
implementation,  this  algorithm  is  successful  in  detecting  the 
cyber-attack, but we should also be concerned about the energy 
consumption of these devices and their battery life estimation. 

Therefore in next section,  we are focusing on the impact 
analysis  of  the  proposed  algorithm  by  conducting  many 
experiments  by  varying  the  operating  environment  such  as 
working lab space and open parking lot. 

IV.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

In this section, we are presenting the results of our impact 

analysis after the implementation of the algorithm.  

As  our  most  important  aspect  is  to  provide  security  for 
these  devices  but  as  we  are  working  with  such  low  powered

indicates 

that  although 

In the topology we have used, the central node acts as an 
attacker  node.  The  results  of  proposed  algorithm  were  also 
compared  with  other  existing  algorithms  to  prove  its  power-
efficiency. As an example, the power consumption analysis of 
our  IDS 
the  real-world  power 
consumption is quite high compared to simulation results, the 
algorithm results in lesser power consumption when compared 
with the system under attack. In figure 5, we can compare the 
energy consumption with and without attack, in simulation and 
on real world motes and with implemented IDS. We considered 
working  lab  space  as  an  environment  to  conduct  experiment 
primarily.  We can clearly observe that   Energy consumption 
increases  significantly  as  the  number  of  nodes  is  increasing. 
With IDS implemented there no significant increase in energy 
consumption.  

In figure 6, we can again compare the energy consumption 
during one-to-one communication in simulation and lab space. 
The  results  are  congruent  to  the  one  we  have  in  figure  6. 
Interference present in the environment can also contribute to 
these changes in energy consumption. In both of these, we ran 
broadcasting example as we change the operating environment 
for both of that experiment. We can observe that from readings 
we  accumulated  in  lab  space  and  parking  lot  there  is  a 
noticeable  difference  in  both  those  operating  environment  as 
there is much interference in parking lot compared to lab space. 
Also,  we  can  notice  that  there  is  also  a  surge  in  resource 
consumption  because  of 
along  with 
interference present.

from the conducted experiment considering open parking lot as 
an  environment  instead  of  working  lab  space.  Similar  to 
previous results the presented in these figures also consists of 
the effects  of  present  interference.  As  for this experiment, we 
chose one to one communication example or Unicast example 
for communication. As for the one to one communication, we 
required lot of resource consumption contrary to our simulation 
results for the same example which we have noticed from our 
previously conducted experiments also [5] 

As  our  previous  study  shows  that  interference  present  in 
the  environment  because  of  electrical  interference,  magnetic 
interference,  etc.,  energy  consumption  increases  significantly 
[5].  On  the  basis  of  the  readings  we  got  from  the  conducted 
experiments we can predict the battery life (T) of the devices 
by using the following equation: 

(cid:3041)

(cid:1831) = (cid:3533) (cid:1848)(cid:1861) ∗ (cid:1835)(cid:1861) ∗ (cid:1846)(cid:1861)

(cid:3036)(cid:2880)(cid:2868)

Where, E= energy in joules, I = current drawn, T = Time, V = 
Voltage, n is the number of overall readings. 

With  the  help  of  this  equation,  we  trace  the  battery 
consumption and can also predict the battery life. This equation 
[5]  also  give  us  detailed  insight  into  the  impact  of  the 
implementation on these devices.  

In figure 9. We can get the exact idea about the battery life 
estimation  of  the  nodes  after  the  implementation  of  IDS  on 
those  nodes  considering  different  environments  such  as 
working lab space and parking lot. As with the help of all the 
parameter  measurements  we  got  from  all  of  the  conducted 
experiments,  we  can  estimate  the  battery  life  with  the 
implementation  of  intrusion  detection  system.  From  the 
referenced figure, we can observe the estimation of battery life 
for  lab  space  and  open  parking  lot.  In  general,  during 
broadcasting  example  with  implemented  IDS  battery  life  is 
more  compared  to  one  to  one  communication.  As  from  our 
conducted  experiment  we  have  concluded  while  IDS  was 
already in place, consumption requirement for broadcasting in 
real  world  mote  is  less  as  compared  to  one  to  one 
communication.  This  can  be  clearly  observed  this  significant 
difference  in  power  consumption  for  these  scenarios  from 
figure 9. 

V.  CONCLUSION 

Considering the prevalence of these IoT devices, before we 
can  employ  these  devices  for  a  critical  application,  security 
aspects need to be addressed. More research in the area of IoT 
device  security  is  needed  to  make  IoT  network  efficient  and 
secure. Therefore, an efficient and secure IDS was proposed in 
this  paper  for  securing  individual  IoT  devices.  This  algorith 
uses  very  low  power,  as  seen  from  the  results,  and  enhances 

security  by  detecting  and  thwarting  cyber-attacks.  The  real-
world experiments using Z1 Zolertia motes (first generation IoT 
devices)  indicated  the  efficacy  of  proposed  technique  in 
different environments. As a limitation, it should be noticed that 
the  algorithm  might  not  work  against  all  types  of  attacks. 
Therefore,  generalization  for  thwarting  more  types  of  attacks 
could be a possible future work.
