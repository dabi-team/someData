ABSTRACT 

A model of strategy formulation is used to study how an adaptive attacker learns to overcome a moving target cyber 
defense. The attacker-defender interaction is modeled as a game in which a defender deploys a temporal platform 
migration  defense.  Against  this  defense,  a  population  of  attackers  develop  strategies  specifying  the  temporal 
ordering  of  resource  investments  that  bring  targeted  zero-day  exploits  into  existence.  Attacker  response  to  two 
defender temporal platform migration scheduling policies are examined. In the first defender scheduling policy, the 
defender selects the active platform in each match uniformly at random from a pool of available platforms. In the 
second  policy  the  defender  schedules  each  successive  platform  to  maximize  the  diversity  of  the  source  code 
presented  to  the  attacker.  Adaptive  attacker  response  strategies  are  modeled  by  finite  state  machine  (FSM) 
constructs  that  evolve  during  simulated  play  against  defender  strategies  via  an  evolutionary  algorithm.  It  is 
demonstrated that the attacker learns to invest heavily in exploit creation for the platform with the least similarity to 
other  platforms  when  faced  with  a  diversity  defense,  while  avoiding  investment  in  exploits  for  this  least  similar 
platform  when  facing  a  randomization  defense.  Additionally,  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  diversity-maximizing 
defense  is  superior  for  shorter  duration  attacker-defender  engagements,  but  performs  sub-optimally  in  extended 
attacker-defender interactions.

INTRODUCTION 

Today  cyber  defenders  are  at  a  systematic  disadvantage  in  cyber  conflict.  Attackers  often  only  need  to  exploit  a 
single  security  vulnerability  to  succeed  with  an  attack,  and  attackers  can  typically  act  at  a  time  and  place  of  their 
choosing.  Furthermore,  the  technological  monocultures  that  dominate  information  technology  today  place  these 
systems  at  significant  risk  for  attack.  With  a  large  number  of  organizations  and  individuals  using  essentially 
identical hardware, operating systems, and application software, significant incentives have been created for cyber 
attackers to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in these systems.  

In this context, new techniques are under development by the cyber security research community to rebalance the 
playing field for cyber defenders. A major effort in recent years along these lines is an attempt by cyber defenders to 
diversify the most vulnerable pieces of the existing large cyber monocultures. These techniques, aiming to increase 
the  diversity  of  a  system's  attack  surface,  causing  increased  operational  costs  and  uncertainty  for  attackers  have 
come to be grouped under the umbrella term moving target. Moving target techniques have been applied to diversify 
runtime  environments,  software,  networks,  platforms,  and  data  in  recent  years  (Okhravi  et  al.,  2013;  Okhravi, 
Hobson, Bigelow, and Streilein, 2014). 

In  this  study,  we  examine  a  class  of  migration-based  techniques  that  dynamically  change  the  platform  (i.e., 
operating  system  (OS))  that  is  active  on  a  host  in  order  to  reduce  attacker  success  and  increase  attacker  resource 
investment  requirements.  These  techniques  work  under  the  assumption  that  the  attacker  has  limited  resources  and 
generally  does  not  have  exploits  available  for  all  OSes.  As  such,  migrating  between  OSes  with  some  frequency 
reduces the ability of an attacker to maintain persistence on a system. Additionally, it increases the uncertainty for 
an attacker that aims to expend resources toward exploit development. 

Two recent studies have examined the optimal scheduling policy for a temporal migration moving target defense. In 
the first the conclusion was drawn that a uniform random scheduling policy by a defender employing a set of active 
spam  filters  performed  optimally  against  an  adaptive  adversary  (Colbaugh  and  Glass,  2012).  The  second  set  of 
studies (Carter, Okhravi, and Riordan, 2013) required the attacker to maintain persistence in a system for a period of 
time  before  reward  accrued.  An  additional  factor  incorporated  in  the  second  set  of  studies  was  that  of  coupled 
exploits, in which a given exploit targeted at a specific OS may work against other similar OSes. It was shown that a 
deterministic scheduling policy that maximizes the diversity of the platforms played in each successive round was 
superior under the assumption of coupled exploits and the requirement of attacker persistence (Carter et al., 2013). 

The  goal  of  this  work  is  to  evaluate  different  scheduling  policy  strategies  against  a  non-deterministic,  adaptive 
attacker.  As  opposed  to  (Colbaugh  and  Glass,  2012)  and  (Carter  et  al.,  2013),  which  posited  a  restrictive  attacker 
model in which an attacker could only develop exploits for OSes presented to it by the defender, we extend our prior 
work (Winterrose and Carter, 2014) to model an adaptive attacker with a less restrictive attacker model. This more 
flexible adversary model allows an attacker to invest in the development of zero-day exploits against any potential 
defender  system.  Attackers  observe  defender  actions  and  use  these  observations  to  learn  optimal  investment 
strategies. We will demonstrate the complex, yet intuitive, strategies that are evolved to optimize attacker success 
against various defender platform migration scheduling policies.

The major contributions of this work are as follows: 

1. We employ a less restrictive attacker model that more accurately captures the resource investment decision

problem faced by an attacker.

2. We  present  the  first  use  of  a  novel  finite  state  machine  (FSM)  construct  that  transitions  between  action

states based on a heterogeneous set of system observations.

3. We  show  that  learned  attacker  strategies  are  highly  sensitive  to  the  statistical  characteristics  of  the

defender's moving target scheduling policy.

4. We demonstrate that the degree to which a defense policy is optimal against an adaptive adversary changes

as the duration of conflict varies.

METHODS 

Attacker/Defender Game Scenario 

Many security scenarios can be modeled as games (Tambe, 2012). Typically this involves the reduction of a given 
adversarial situation to its most essential elements, casting the salient features of a security conflict in stark relief. 
Done well, this procedure facilitates the discovery of the deeper mechanisms underlying a real-world phenomenon 
by eliminating the non-essential aspects of a situation. 

In our scenario the attacker, characterized by a population of N strategies, plays a series of games made up of sets of 
consecutive  matches  against  the  defender.  A  simulated  game  between  the  attacker  and  the  defender  is  played  in 
which  time  advances  in  discrete  steps.  A  single  match  is  executed  at  each  tick  of  the  simulation  clock.  In  each 
match, a deterministic defender activates one platform according to a pre-determined defense strategy. The attacker 
observes  the  defender's  choice  and  must  decide  how  to  allocate  resources  in  the  next  round  to  bring  exploits  into 
existence  so  as  to  attack  the  defender's  system  with  an  optimal  chance  of  success.  All  exploits  in  this  study  are 
assumed  to  be  zero-day  exploits,  meaning  that  they  are  unobserved  by  the  defender  when  used  against  the 
corresponding operating system. 

In the simulated game there exists one possible zero-day exploit for each type of platform the defender might deploy 
in the temporal platform migration defensive system. In each match of the game, the attacker may choose to use its 
resources to further develop one of these zero-day exploits. 

The attacker resources (i.e., the number of rounds of attacker resource investment) required to bring a given zero-
day  exploit  into  existence  is  determined  by  sampling  from  a  Gamma  distribution  at  the  beginning  of  each 
generation. The attacker is not informed a priori of the number of resources that will be required to bring a zero-day 
exploit  against  a  given  platform  into  existence.  Instead  the  attacker  discovers  this  only  after  having  successfully 
created  the  exploit  through  the  allocation  of  sufficient  resources.  Additionally  the  attacker  must  learn  when  to 
discontinue  investment  in  the  creation  of  a  particular  exploit  once  the  required  number  of  resources  has  been 
invested,  as  continued  investment  will  be  wasted.  This  is  used  to  model  the  fact  that  a  real-world  attacker  is  not 
generally  able  to  predict  a  priori  the  level  of  effort  that  will  be  required  to  develop  new  exploits  against  a  given 
system. 

In  each  match,  the  attacker  uses  any  exploits  that  have  been  developed  in  the  current  game  against  the  activated 
platform. Success for the attacker in a match occurs when it has an available exploit that works against the platform 
activated by the defender. Intuitively, the attacker gains a reward if the attacker is able to compromise the defender's 
system  during  the  match,  and  earns  nothing  otherwise.  For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  we  impose  a  persistence 
requirement on the adversary, such that a reward is granted only after 3 consecutive successful matches. One may 
view this as the requisite length of time to stage an attack, such as the exfiltration of data over a difficult channel, 
with a cumulative reward being granted each match while the full attack is successful (i.e., ≥ 3 matches) (Carter et 
al., 2013).

In  this  study  we  allow  the  defender  access  to  the  pool  of  5  platforms:  Fedora  on  x86,  Gentoo  on  x86,  Debian  on 
x86_64, FreeBSD on x86, and CentOS on x86. In the randomization defense, in each match an OS is selected from 
the pool of 5 for activation on the defender's system uniformly at random, with the caveat that the OS activated in 
the  present  match  cannot  be  activated  again  in  the  immediate  next  match.  The  diversity  defense  consists  of  the 
deterministic activation of Fedora, Debian, and FreeBSD in succession (Carter et al., 2013). This rotation between 3 
platforms maximizes the diversity of the source code presented to the attacker from match to match and reduces the 
likelihood that an exploit developed for one OS can persist when that OS is replaced by the next OS in the rotation. 

The  attacker  can  develop  a  targeted  exploit  for  each  of  the  defender  operating  systems.  A  targeted  exploit  works 
with certainty each time it is used against the platform it targets. In our model a developed exploit also works against 
platforms  other  than  the  exploit's  target  system  with  a  probability  proportional  to  the  code  similarity  of  the  two 
operating  systems.  We  term  this  effectiveness  of  an  exploit  against  systems  other  than  the  target  system  its  cross 
platform effectiveness. 

Table  1  lists  a  set  of  code  similarity  scores  for  the  defender's  operating  systems.  These  similarity  scores  were 
calculated using the Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS) tool (Schleimer, Wilkerson, and Aiken, 2003) and are 
based on each operating system's kernel code and standard device drivers (Carter et al., 2013). The similarity scores 
are  given  on  a  scale  from  0  to  1,  with  1  implying  identical  operating  system  code  and  0  indicating  completely 
dissimilar operating system code.

We note that FreeBSD is an outlier in the set with a markedly low similarity score compared with the remainder of 
the set. This is explained by the fact that FreeBSD is based on Unix while the other 4 operating systems are Linux-
based.  In  the  sections  that  follow  the  outlier  status  of  the  FreeBSD  platform  will  be  shown  to  have  a  significant 
impact on attacker strategy development. 

In this study the cross-platform effectiveness is determined on a match-by-match basis. On each match the attacker 
plays all available exploits against the defender activated platform If the attacker has developed the exploit targeted 
at the activated defender's system then the attacker succeeds with the attack with certainty. On the other hand, if the 
targeted exploit has not been created by the attacker for the activated platform, any other created exploits succeed 
against the defender's system with a probability equal to the similarity score between the exploit's targeted system 
and the system activated by the defender. 

Finite State Machine Strategy Encoding 

We represent attacker strategies as binary chromosomes encoding a FSM construct. An FSM is an abstract machine 
that takes discrete inputs from an environment and specifies a discrete output in response. An agent modeled by an 
FSM will occupy only one state at any point in time. Such an agent transitions between states based on observations 
of its environment.

Figure 1.  Hypothetical single automata state and corresponding outgoing transition set of an attacker's FSM 
(upper). E, P, S, and F represent Exploit investment, Platform observation, Successful attack, and Failed attack 
by  the  attacker,  respectively.  The  finite  automata  state  maps  into  a  binary  chromosome  in  which  bits  are 
represented by # ∈ {0, 1}. Portion (a) of the chromosome encodes the attacker investment in zero-day exploit 
creation  when  the  attacker  occupies  this  hypothetical  state  using  3-bits.  Segments  (b)  and  (c)  of  the 
chromosome encode two possible transitions executed in response to observation of the defender's activations 
and the attacker's success in the current round. The transitions are encoded using 4-bits each 

Each strategy in our 30-strategy population is represented by one 16-state, 160-transition FSM. Each state encodes 
up to 8 possible actions, leading to a 692-bit chromosome encoded in a manner similar to (Miller, 1996; Winterrose, 
2014). Figure 1 depicts a single state in our machine and its outgoing transitions. 

The 30 machines are initialized randomly before the simulation begins. During the simulation the actions encoded in 
each state of each machine and the transitions between states evolve according to the genetic algorithm presented in 
the next section. 

We  use  16-state  FSMs  for  historical  reasons  (Miller,  1996),  but  find  through  ancillary  studies  that  the  actual 
strategies evolved by attackers generally fit easily within our 16-state constraint. An extended study with a widely 
varying number of machine states would shed useful light on the consequences of bounded rationality on the nature 
of strategies evolved in the cyber domain. 

Our  FSMs  transition  between  states  based  on  both  the  type  of  platform  activated  by  the  defender  in  the  previous 
round  and  on  the  success  the  attacker  had  with  its  exploit  attacks  in  the  previous  round.  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge,  this  dual-observation  transition  model  is  unique  to  this  study.  Previous  studies  using  a  simpler,  but 
related, FSM construct to play the Prisoner's Dilemma game-theoretic scenario (Miller, 1996) transitioned between 
machine states based on a single observation of opponent action in each round of play. 

Evolutionary Algorithm 

The adaptive attacker in our study evolves strategies against the defender using a genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland, 
1975). Originally conceived as a stylized model of biological evolution, the GA has proven to be a robust method 
that  can  efficiently  search  solution  spaces  that  are  nonlinear  and/or  discontinuous.  In  our  implementation  we 
randomly initialize 30 strategies at the outset of a simulation run. In each generation each agent (i.e., strategy) plays 
a game consisting of M matches against the defender. 

In  a  match,  if  the  defender's  active  platform  is  vulnerable  to  an  exploit  that  has  been  successfully  developed,  the 
attacker  accrues  a  reward,  governed  by  some  underlying  function  that  is  hidden  from  the  algorithm.  This  may 

April 2014 Page 5 of 11 

 
      
include immediate reward, or for example, require some level of consecutive success before a reward is granted (e.g. 
persistence). See (Carter et al., 2013) for example scenarios and associated reward functions. 

Once the reward is computed, the match is concluded. A new match begins with the attacker choosing an exploit to 
develop  with  its  allocated  resources  (one  resource  is  available  for  investment  by  the  attacker  in  each  match). 
Concurrently, the defender selects a platform to make active in the system, against which the attacker moves with 
any available exploits. This continues for M matches, at which point the game ends between the chosen attacker and 
the  defender,  and  a  new  attacker  strategy  from  the  population  is  rotated  in  to  play  against  the  defender.  Once  all 
attackers  have  played  their  M  matches  in  the  generation  (g)  against  the  defender,  each  strategy,  i,  is  assigned  a 
fitness score, F, based on its success against the defender,

with Φ!,!   set equal to +1 if the system is compromised, and set equal to 0 otherwise. Attacker strategies are ranked 
based on their fitness scores. A new population of attacker strategies is generated for play against the defender using 
the following steps: 

1. A fraction of the top ranked attacker strategies are copied directly into the new population. This procedure
is known as elitism and is commonly used in GA applications to avoid the loss of the best strategies from
previous strategy populations (Mitchell, 1996).

2. Two  attacker  strategies  are  chosen  from  the  current  population  using  fitness  proportionate  selection  in

which higher ranking strategies are more likely to be selected.

3. The  two  selected  (parent)  strategies  undergo  the  crossover  genetic  operation  (analogous  to  biological
sexual  reproduction)  to  generate  two  offspring  strategies.  In  this  operation,  a  single  crossover  point  c  ∈
{1,2,  .  .  .  n}  on  each  of  two  parent  chromosomes  is  selected  uniformly  at  random.  The  first  offspring
combines the first c bits from the first parent with all bits after the c+1 chromosome position of the second
parent to form a new chromosome. The second offspring takes all bits after the c+1 chromosome position
from parent 1 and combines it with the first c bits of parent two's chromosome to form a new strategy.

4. The  two  offspring  strategies  are  then  subject  to  the  mutation  genetic  operation  (analogous  to  asexual
reproduction).  In  this  operation  bits  in  the  chromosome  are  randomly  altered.  The  mutation  operation  is
commonly used in GA applications to increase population diversity and avoid local extrema in the search
space (Michalewicz, 1996).

5. The two generated offspring strategies are then added to the new population.

6. The above steps are repeated until the new population has a sufficient number of strategies (specified by a

population number parameter).

Attacker  strategies  are  evolved  over  a  set  of  generations  where  each  generation  includes  the  attacker-defender 
simulated games and the above steps to generate new populations of strategies. 

EXPERIMENTS 

Simulation Initialization 

The defender's dynamic platform scheduling policy is assigned at the beginning of the game and is not altered as the 
game progresses. The attacker's strategy is represented by a population of randomly initialized strategies encoded as 
binary chromosomes representing FSMs. Each iteration of the simulation is allowed to run for 100 generations of 
genetic  algorithm  evolution,  with  the  attacker  strategy  being  evolved  in  each  of  these  generations.  A  single 

April 2014 Page 6 of 11 

 
generation consists of each of the N=30 attackers playing M matches against the defender. The 100-generation run is 
iterated 100 times and the results aggregated and averaged to account for the stochasticity in the model. 

The  number  of  attacker  resources  required  to  bring  a  given  zero-day  exploit  into  existence  is  determined  at  the 
beginning of each generation by independent draws from a Gamma distribution for each of the 5 possible zero-day 
exploits  available  for  development  by  the  attacker,  similar  to  the  procedure  we  used  in  (Winterrose  and  Carter, 
2014).  The  Gamma  distribution  is  parameterized  by  a  mean  (µ)  and  variance  (σ2)  parameter.  We  use  µ  =25  and 
σ2=10 throughout this study. 

In  the  analysis  that  follows  we  typically  extract  the  fittest  learned  attacker  strategy  in  each  generation  of  each 
simulation run and aggregate these together to produce the results discussed. This procedure is consistent with the 
focus in this paper on the nature of the optimal attacker strategies developed against the defender's moving target 
defense. We refer to this set of fittest strategies extracted from each simulation run as the fittest attackers or fittest 
strategies hereafter. 

Simulations were created and executed in the NetLogo modeling environment (Wilensky, 1999). Data aggregation 
across  simulation  runs  and  the  calculation  of  statistical  measures  was  carried  out  using  MATLAB  release  2013b 
(Matlab, 2013). To visualize the evolved FSMs we have used the Gephi network visualization and analysis software 
package (Bastian, Heymann, and Jacomy, 2009). 

Attacker’s Response to Diversity and Randomization Defense 

Figure  2  shows  the  match-level  response  at  the  100th  generation  of  genetic  algorithm  evolution  for  the  fittest 
attackers  averaged  over  100  simulation  runs.  The  attacker  performs  better  against  the  randomization  defense 
throughout  the  100-match  game,  but  the  difference  in  performance  narrows  as  the  match  number  increases.  We 
recall  that  the  attacker  must  compromise  the  defender's  system  for  3  consecutive  matches  using  its  developed 
exploits before beginning to accrue a reward for system compromise. Figure 2 shows that this begins to occur at an 
earlier  point  in  match  play  when  the  attacker  faces  the  randomization  defense.  Specifically,  the  attacker's  fitness 
begins  to  rise  around  match  number  40  when  the  attacker  faces  the  randomization  defense,  roughly  the  point  at 
which  an  efficient  attacker  might  begin  to  have  access  to  2  exploits  given  this  studies'  exploit  creation  cost 
parameterization.  With  2  exploits  created  the  attacker  can  utilize  the  cross-platform  effectiveness  of  the  created 
exploits to achieve the persistence required for accruing attacker reward.

discussion.

Against the diversity defense, on the other hand, the attacker does not begin accumulating reward until just before 
match  60.  Between  the  60th  and  75th  match  the  attacker's  reward  (i.e.,  fitness)  climbs  slowly,  then  accelerates 
sharply  after  approximately  match  75.  This  can  be  understood  by  recalling  that  once  the  attacker  has  had  the 
opportunity  to  develop  3  targeted  exploits  it  is  able  to  completely  counter  the  diversity  defense.  This  causes  the 
fitness  of  the  attacker  facing  the  diversity  defense  to  quickly  approach  the  fitness  of  the  attacker  facing  the 
randomization defense.

Figure  3.  Structural  representation  of  an  exemplar  attacker  strategy  developed  to  counter  the  diversity 
defense. The strategies are encoded in a FSM. Nodes are labeled by the investment to be made by the attacker 
in  the  various  machine  states.  Edges  represent  transitions  between  states  based  on  observations  of  the 
defender's actions and successful game play. See text for further discussion. 

Figure 3 shows the structural properties of an exemplar FSM encoding an attacker's evolved strategy when facing 
the diversity defense. In the figure the node and label sizes are proportional to the number of transitions into a given 
state. The importance of the Fedora, Debian, and FreeBSD exploit development in the learned attacker strategy are 
clear in this FSM representation. In particular, FreeBSD is the most prevalent investment state in the structure, a fact 
we discuss in the next section. 

Patterns of Attacker Investment in Zero-Day Exploit Creation 

An  important  consideration  when  deciding  upon  a  deployment  strategy  for  a  dynamic  platform  moving  target 
defense  is  how  the  attacker  is  likely  to  alter  its  strategy  based  on  the  defender's  choices.  For  this  experiment,  we 
were  interested  in  understanding  how  the  statistical  characteristics  of  the  defender's  scheduling  policy  affects 
attacker exploit creation investment choices. 

The basic choice the attacker faces is the manner in which to invest its resource in each round to compromise the 
attacker's system with maximum effectiveness. The key considerations for the attacker in achieving this goal is the 
persistence requirement (i.e., 3 consecutive successful attacks before attacker reward accrues) and the cross-platform 
effectiveness  of  each  zero-day  exploit.  The  need  to  weigh  these  factors  together  with  the  observations  of  the 
defender's dynamic platform scheduling policy make the investment choice a complex one for the attacker. 

Figure  4  shows  the  generational  investment  patterns  learned  by  the  fittest  attackers  aggregated  across  the  100 
simulation runs. It is clear that the statistical character of the defender's scheduling policy strongly affects the exploit 
investment pattern of the attacker. The largest effects are observed in the preference or disdain the attacker shows 
for  developing  the  FreeBSD  zero-day  exploit.  Figure  4a  shows  that  when  facing  the  randomizing  defender  the 
attacker prefers to minimize investment in the FreeBSD exploit and focus investment on the creation of exploits for 
the Linux-based platforms. This behavior contrasts sharply with the attacker's response to the diversity-maximizing 
defender (Fig. 4b). Here the attacker shows a strong preference for developing the FreeBSD exploit.

Figure  4.  Generational  progression  of  fittest  attacker  exploit  creation  investments  averaged  over  100 
simulation runs. Investment patterns of attackers facing a randomized defender scheduling policy (a) differ 
markedly from the investment patterns developed by the evolving attackers facing a diversity defense (b). 

We note that in Fig. 4 the attacker has discovered these investment patterns already in the initial generation. This 
early  discovery  of  the  fittest  attacker  strategy  is  essentially  a  matter  of  luck.  The  process  of  learning  these 
investment  patterns  is  more  evident  when  examining  the  evolution  of  investment  patterns  within  the  entire 
population  of  N=30  attackers,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.    Here  we  see  the  population  mean  investment  in  each  of  the 
available exploits distributed approximately uniformly in the initial generation, then diverging strongly in just a few 
generations as the population converges on the strategies of avoiding FreeBSD exploit investment when facing the 
randomized defense (Fig. 5a), and investing heavily in FreeBSD exploit creation when facing the diversity defense 
in Fig. 5b.

Figure  5.  Generational  progression  of  mean  attacker  exploit  creation  investments  for  the  entire  attacker 
population of N=30 strategies. Displayed results are aggregated and averaged over 100 simulation runs. As in 
the fittest attacker case, investment patterns of attackers facing a randomized defender scheduling policy (a) 
are  quite  different  from  the  investment  patterns  developed  by  the  evolving  attackers  facing  a  diversity 
defense (b). 

These trends can be understood by taking account of the following observations. When facing the diversity defense 
the attacker can predict with certainty that it will face a defender activating the FreeBSD platform reliably every 3 
matches. Given the dissimilarity of FreeBSD with the other 4 platforms, this makes it improbable that the attacker 
will achieve the requirement of 3-match persistence across the FreeBSD activation if the FreeBSD exploit has not 
been  created.  When  the  attacker  is  facing  the  randomization  defense,  in  contrast,  there  exists  a  reasonable 
probability that the attacker will achieve the persistence requirement and accrue reward without facing activation of 
the FreeBSD platform by the defender. The predictability of needing to overcome a FreeBSD activation in the first 
case  (i.e.,  diversity  defense),  and  the  uncertainty  of  facing  a  FreeBSD  activation  in  the  second  case  (i.e., 
randomization defense) rationalizes the investment patterns in Fig. 4 and 5.

Engagement Duration Effects 

Another important consideration when deciding upon a deployment strategy for a dynamic platform moving target 
defense  is  the  duration  of  the  interaction.    For  this  experiment,  we  were  interested  in  understanding  how  attacker 
fitness  in  the  face  of  diversity  and  random  strategies  was  affected  by  different  interaction  (i.e.,  game)  durations. 
Figure 6 demonstrates that the duration of attacker/defender interaction greatly affects the efficacy of the defensive 
capability,  which  is  reflected  inversely  in  the  fitness  level  of  the  attacker:  better  attacker  fitness  implies  worse 
defensive capability.  In Fig. 6a we see that the attacker achieves a high level of fitness for a 75-Match game when a 
random  strategy  is  utilized.    By  contrast,  when  the  defender  utilizes  the  diversity  strategy,  the  attacker  never 
achieves a similar level of fitness, though the overall level of fitness does increase with generation.  As the duration 
of  the  games  increases,  through  100-Match  and  125-Match  games,  Fig.  6  shows  that  the  value  of  the  diversity 
strategy diminishes for longer duration interactions.  Specifically, when 100-Match games are played, the attacker 
fitness level is roughly equivalent for random and diversity strategy at the start, with the diversity strategy initially 
performing  sub-optimally  and  then  improving.    When  the  125-match  games  are  played,  the  diversity  strategy  is 
always sub-optimal to the random strategy in providing effective defense by allowing the attacker fitness to reach a 
higher  level.    It  is  worth  noting  that  the  absolute  fitness  level  achieved  by  the  attacker  increases  overall  as  the 
interaction duration increases regardless of the defensive strategy employed.  This is due to the fact that the attacker 
is provided with more time to develop an exploit in all cases regardless of the defensive strategy in use and thus is 
able to improve fitness level. 

To  understand  the  benefit  provided  at  shorter  durations  by  the  diversity  strategy  it  is  instructive  to  consider  that 
although  the  attacker  is  able  to  focus  his  resources  on  a  smaller  set  of  target  OSes,  the  shorter  duration  makes  it 
difficult  to  achieve  all  exploits  needed  to  compromise  the  system  with  the  required  persistence.    As  the  duration 
increases,  the  attacker  is  more  likely  to  develop  targeted  exploits  for  the  entire  set  of  the  OSes  in  the  diversity 
strategy  before  the  interaction  ends  and  thus  is  able  to  achieve  persistent  compromise.    When  the  game  duration 
reaches 125 matches, the random strategy provides more defensive benefit due to the attacker's increased difficulty 
in predicting future OSes relative to the diversity strategy. 

As a result of these simulated experiments, it is recommended that when interaction with an attacker can be kept to a 
short duration, a diversity strategy is preferred.  The specific length of the duration that is optimal depends upon the 
expected time it would take the attacker to develop the exploits.

CONCLUSION 

We  have  developed  a  model  of  adaptive  attacker  strategy  evolution  and  used  it  to  investigate  the  strategies  an 
attacker  develops  to  overcome  two  temporal  platform  migration  moving  target  defense  strategies.  The  attacker-
defender  interaction  has  been  modeled  as  a  game  in  which  a  non-adaptive  defender  deploys  a  randomization  or  a 
diversity  moving  target  defense.  Against  these  dynamic  platform  scheduling  policies  a  population  of  attackers 
develop  strategies  specifying  the  temporal  ordering  of  resource  investments  that  bring  zero-day  exploits  into 
existence to compromise the defender's system. 

The  results  of  this  study  have  strong  implications  for  real-world  defenders.  First,  defenders  deploying  dynamic 
platform defenses and anticipating attacks over difficult channels (i.e., requiring persistence to succeed), should be

particularly  vigilant  regarding  the  systems  in  their  rotation-set  with  outlier  status  in  attributes  relevant  to  an 
attacker's success. It is these outlier systems that advanced attackers will devote the largest proportion of resources 
to compromising. Furthermore, our results suggest that diversity-maximizing defenses are most effective for short 
duration  attacker/defender  encounters.  The  crucial  parameter  in  this  regard  is  the  time  required  for  an  attacker  to 
bring exploits into existence versus the duration of the attacker's encounter with the defender's system. 

Future directions of interest for investigation include the incorporation of noise into the attacker's observation model 
in  order  to  bring  the  game  scenario  nearer  to  conditions  likely  to  prevail  for  real-world  attackers  and  the 
incorporation of an adaptive defender into our cyber game scenario.
