Abstract

Understanding cascading failures or epidemics in networks is crucial for developing effective

defensive mechanisms for many critical systems and infrastructures (e.g. biological, social and cyber

networks). Most of the existing works treat the network topology as being exogenously given and

study under what conditions an epidemic breaks out and/or extinguishes. However, if agents are able

to strategically decide their connections according to their own self-interest, the network will instead

be endogenously formed and evolving. In such systems, the epidemic, agents’ strategic decisions and

the network structure become complexly coupled and co-evolve. As a result, existing knowledge may

no longer be applicable. Built on a continuous time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible epidemic model

with strong mixing, this paper studies stochastic epidemic networks consisting of strategic agents, who

decide the number of links to form based on a careful evaluation of its current obtainable beneﬁt and the

potential future cost due to infection by forming links. A game theoretical framework is developed to

analyze such networks and a number of important insights are obtained. One key result is that whereas

an epidemic eventually dies out if the effective spreading rate is sufﬁciently low in exogenously given

networks, it never dies out when agents are strategic regardless of the effective spreading rate. This

property leads to reduced achievable system efﬁciency and considerably different optimal protection

mechanisms. Without understanding the strategic behavior of agents, signiﬁcant security cost may incur.

I. INTRODUCTION

2

Much of society is organized in networks (biological, social, economic, cyber etc.) and

networks are important because individuals gain beneﬁts (e.g. information, resource, pleasure

etc.) through the interactions with their connected neighbors. But networks also face many

vulnerabilities which otherwise would not exist if individuals were isolated. One of the most

signiﬁcant perhaps is cascading failures or epidemics — viruses (e.g. diseases in human society

and computer viruses on the Internet) may spread over the network and damage the society via

the links between connected individuals.

There has been a signiﬁcant effort in the literature [1]–[5] devoted to understanding how

and under what conditions viruses become epidemic, which is crucial for designing effective

protection mechanisms to prevent damage. Most works in this literature study epidemics under

a common assumption, namely the networks are exogenously determined (according to either a

ﬁxed topology or a ﬁxed degree distribution). However, much less knowledge exists for networks

that are endogenously formed by strategic agents who can decide their connections according

to their own interests. In the presence of strategic agents, connection decisions and epidemics

are interdependent and hence, tremendously different results regarding, e.g. how viruses become

epidemic and how to design effective protection mechanisms, may emerge. The objective of this

paper is to advance knowledge in this regard.

This paper builds on the widely-adopted Suspectable-Infected-Suspectable (SIS) model [2]

with strong mixing in a continuous time setting. The most prominent feature of our model is

that agents participating in the network are strategically deciding how many links to form at each

time based on a careful cost-beneﬁt evaluation, rather than simply interact with others over an

exogenously given network. Forming links have two opposite effects on the agent: on one hand,

forming more links creates more beneﬁts to the agent (due to e.g. more information, resource and

pleasure). On the other hand, forming more links exposes the agent to a greater infection threat,

which may cause potential future costs to the agent. What makes the problem challenging is that

the level of infection threat depends not only on the agent’s own decision but also on all other

agents’ connection decisions since an epidemic is network-wide. In this paper, we develop a

game-theoretical framework to model and analyze such strategic behavior of agents in epidemic

networks and the implications on optimal network protection. In the considered scenario, agents

3

are continuously interacting with each other and facing stochastic infection threats. Therefore,

agents are assumed to be foresighted rather than myopic. As a result, the conventional equilibrium

concept for one-shot games (i.e. Nash equilibrium) is no longer adequate. In this paper, we adopt

the conjectural equilibrium [6] as the solution concept. Our model does not exogenously restrict

what networks can emerge and does not pose connection constraints. However, the resulting

network will depend on speciﬁc assumptions on the connection beneﬁt function. Although our

model is stylized, many important insights can be obtained for designing effective protection

mechanisms against epidemics:

• A fundamental result in the literature studying exogenously given epidemic networks is that

there is a critical effective spreading rate (i.e. the virus infection rate divided by the curing

rate) below which an epidemic eventually extinguishes. This result no longer holds when

networks are endogenously formed by strategic agents: for any effective spreading rate, an

epidemic never dies out.

• Suppose that the network operator can protect the network by choosing to immunize (a

fraction of) the agents (at a cost). When networks are exogenously given, immunizing all

agents is never the optimal strategy even if the immunization cost is low because it is

not necessary. However, when networks are endogenously formed, immunizing all agents

indeed will be the optimal strategy when the immunization cost is sufﬁciently low.

• More importantly, the optimal level of immunization protection has a much more complex

dependency on the immunization cost in the strategic case than the non-strategic case. Ignor-

ing the strategic link formation behavior of agents may result in sub-optimal immunization

deployment, thereby signiﬁcantly increasing the total network cost caused by the epidemic.

• The strategic behavior of agents reduces the achievable system efﬁciency (deﬁned as the

expected utility per capita) and how much the efﬁciency is reduced depends on the shape

of the beneﬁt function of connections. A detailed price of anarchy analysis for the game is

provided.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss related work and

highlight the contribution of this paper. Section III develops the system model and introduces

the solution concept. In Section IV, we study epidemics in exogenously given networks for

comparison purposes. In Section V, we study epidemics in endogenously formed networks.

4

Section VI extends the basic model for homogeneous agents to heterogeneous agents. Numerical

results are provided in Section VII. Section VIII concludes the paper and points out future work

directions.

II. RELATED WORK

Epidemic models can be traced back to McKendrick and Kermack [1], which studies a

Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Since then various mathematical models

have been developed for studying epidemics in biological networks and computer networks.

The current paper studies the SIS epidemic model [2], [3], [7]–[10], which is another standard

stochastic model for virus infections. In SIS models, individuals are either susceptible or infected:

susceptible individuals can be infected and once they have cured/recovered, they are immediately

susceptible. Existing works in this regard can be roughly divided into two categories. The ﬁrst

category [2], [7], [8] adopts a mean-ﬁeld approximation to study networks consisting of a large

number of agents. Recently, the second category [3], [9], [10] tries to understand the inﬂuence of

graph characteristics on epidemic spreading rather than a simple homogeneous system. Despite

that different mathematical formalisms and tools are adopted, a common fundamental result

derived by these models is that there exists a critical effective spreading rate (i.e. the virus

infection rate divided by the curing rate) below which the epidemic dies out. For the ﬁrst

category, the critical threshold depends on the degree of the network; for the second category,

the critical threshold depends on the largest eigenvalue of the adjacent matrix of the interaction

graph. All these works study networks that are exogenously given and agents cannot change

the network structure. The present paper signiﬁcantly departs from this strand of literature and

studies strategic agents who form the network endogenously.

Game theoretical frameworks were developed before to study the strategic behavior of agents

in epidemic networks. However, the strategic behavior is of a different kind. In these works,

agents decide their investment in self-protection, which has an effect in either reducing their

individual infection rate [11] or improving their individual curing rate [12]. More broadly, there

is a strand of literature studying individual agent’s investment decision in network security games

[?], [13]–[15], taking into account the interdependent security risks induced by the interaction

network. However, again, the networks in this literature are assumed to be ﬁxed.

Endogenously formed networks by strategic agents are studied under the framework of network

5

formation games [?], [16], [17]. In most of these works, agents form links only because they

can gain beneﬁts from the links (minus constant link cost). Only until recently do researchers

begin to study strategic network formation with adversarial attacks and contagious risks [18],

[19]. For instance, [19] characterizes equilibrium network topologies for games in which agents

decide their connections and whether or not to immunize themselves to protect against attack.

The current paper studies a very different problem and adopts a very different model. First,

we consider a large network and hence adopt a mean-ﬁeld model. Therefore, our results are in

terms of network degrees rather than the speciﬁc graph. Second, we consider repeated interactions

and hence adopt a continuous time model whereas in [19], agents make the decision only once

before the attacker moves. Thirdly, we consider a stochastic epidemic setting in which agents are

randomly infected and randomly cured. In contrast, [19] adopts a deterministic infection model

— non-immunized agents reachable to the attacker are attacked and will not be recovered.

In the biological epidemiology research, it is increasingly recognized that a key component

of successful infection control effort is understanding the complex, two-way interaction between

disease dynamics and human behavioral and social dynamics [20]. Early works study optimal vac-

cination policies [21], [22]. Recently, economic and game theoretical models have been developed

to understand infectious disease transmission when people can engage in public avoidance/social

distancing/contact precautions. [23] studies a SIR epidemic model with strong mixing and uses

a differential game to study the potential value of social distancing as a mitigation measure.

The results are supported by numerical results but a theoretical characterization is missing. [24]

studies an SIS model in the discrete time setting with strong mixing and later [25] studies the SIR

counterpart. Different from our model, agents in these works are solving a myopic best response

in each time slot due to the introduction of an explicit infection cost function. In our paper,

infection cost is embedded in the future inability to gain beneﬁt and thus, agents are making

foresighted decisions. Moreover, whereas [24], [25] mostly focus on equilibrium/steady state

characterization, we explicitly study the optimal protection mechanism as well as the efﬁciency

loss due to the strategic behavior.

A. Setting

III. MODEL

We consider a large number of agents interacting over a continuous inﬁnite time horizon

6

system. At any t, each agent is in one of the two states st

S =

H, I

where “H” stands

∈

{

}

for “Healthy” and “I” stands for “Infected”. The system state, denoted by θt, is the fraction

of infected agents at time t. We will investigate both cases that the system state θt is known

and not known to individual agents. However, we assume that the state of an agent is private

information and hence is not known to any other agent in the network at any time. For now, we

assume that agents are homogeneous. We will discuss heterogenous agents in Section VI.

Healthy agent At any time t, a healthy agent i can choose to form a directed link i

j with

→

any other agent j in the network. Forming a link creates beneﬁts to agent i that initiates the

link but not agent j. This resembles the widely adopted followers model (e.g. Twitter). Since

agents are homogeneous and agent states are private information, from agent i’s perspective,

every other agent j

= i appears to be the same. Thus, what matters to agent i is the number of

links that it forms and the beneﬁt that agent i can obtain only depends on the number of links
Z+ that it forms. To simplify our analysis, instead of assuming that the number of links

Forming links creates beneﬁts. Let b(x) denote the instantaneous beneﬁt function depending

on the link formation action x. This means that the beneﬁt created in a time interval ∆t is b(x)∆t

if x links are formed. We assume that b(x) is continuous and twice-differentiable with b(0) = 0,

b′(x) > 0, b′′(x) < 0. These are standard assumptions which state that the beneﬁt function is

increasing with diminishing return. On the other hand, forming links also incurs direct costs. We

assume a linear cost function, namely c(x) = c0x. The instantaneous utility by taking an action

large for any link to form. With b′(0) > c0, it is easy to see that there exists an optimal action
x, denoted by W , that maximizes the utility u(x). Moreover, we have u′(x) > 0,

Infected agent At any time t, an infected agent cannot take any active action (meaning that it

cannot form links with others and obtain utility). This is a natural situation when, for example,

the virus has taken over control of this agent or the agent has broken down. The infected agent

will instead go through a curing process. Once the infected agent is cured and become healthy

again, it can form links with others. The curing period follows a negative exponential distribution

with parameter δ > 0 and the agent losses any utility it can potentially obtain during this period.

Note that in the considered model, the cost due to infection is not explicit; rather, it is implicit

as a result of the inability to receive utility. This differs from previous works which assume

explicit infection costs. We believe that this is a valid and more natural formulation especially

when the direct curing cost is much less than the utility that the agent would have obtained if

it were healthy.

Infection Since a healthy agent may initiate to form a link with an infected agent (because

the healthy agent does not know the state of any other node), it may get infected via the link

that it forms. We model the infection on each link (with an infected node) as a Poison process

with arrival rate β. At the ﬁrst arrival instance, the healthy agent gets infected. The infection

may be sooner (or the infection probability is higher) if the healthy agent forms more links to

infected agents. In particular, if a healthy agent forms links with y infected agent, the infection

arrival rate is yβ.

B. Strategy and long-term utility

The strategy of an agent i is the number of links at

i to form at any time t when it is in the
healthy state. We start with the case that agents do not know the system state θt. In this case,

each agent i has the same information set at any time and hence, it adopts a constant strategy
i = H. We will study the case that agents observe the system state θt in Section

at
i = ai,
V.B.

t : st
∀

If agents are myopic and care about only the instantaneous utility, then it is obvious that the

optimal strategy of any healthy agent is ai = W at any time since doing so maximizes the

current time (myopic) utility. However, since agents are interacting with each other for a long

time period, they will instead be foresighted and care about the expected long-term utility. It is

noteworthy that the expected long-term utility may be different from the realized utility but it

is the expected long-term utility that is important for decision making.

Next, we deﬁne and compute the expected long-term utility if an agent takes a constant strategy

ai. The long-term utility of an agent depends on the state that it is in as well as the strategies
taken by other agents. Let UH (ai, a−i) and UI(ai, a−i) denote the long-term utilities when the

8

agent is in the healthy state and infected state, respectively, by taking strategy ai while the other
agents take the strategies a−i. They are deﬁned recursively as follows:

aj,

j
∀

}

{

agents other than i. We elaborate this deﬁnition below:

• Suppose the agent is infected at time t0 + t where t0 is the time of the decision making,
τ =0 e−ρτ u(ai)dτ is the discounted long-term utility that the agent can receive during
1 and decreases with τ , which means that the

the period [t0, t0 + t]. Notice that e−ρτ

then

present value of utility is smaller if the same utility is realized at a later time, thereby

discounting. Moreover, a larger ρ means that the discounting effect is greater. Using e−ρτ

to model discounting is the standard way for continuous time systems.

• e−ρtUI(ai) is the continuation utility that the agent receives once it gets infected. Since the
agent is infected at a later time t0 + t, the utility is discounted by e−ρt. The value of this

utility is UI as the agent enters the infection state at this time point.

• βi(a)e−βi(a)t is the probability distribution function of the infection time t, which follows
a negative exponential distribution of parameter βi(a) due to our model. In particular,
βi(a) = θi(a)aiβ where β is the per-link infection rate and θi(a) is the probability that

agent i connects to an infected node on each link. Notice that this probability is a result

of all agents’ strategies and hence, agent i’s long-term utility depends on not only its own

strategy but also others’.

• When an agent enters the infection state, it receives 0 instantaneous utility. At a later time

t, which follows the distribution δe−δtdt, it is cured and returns to the healthy state and the

continuation utility is UH discounted by e−ρt.

Since we consider a sufﬁciently large population of agents, we adopt the mean-ﬁeld approxi-

9

mation that θi(a) = θj(a),

i, j. This approximation can be well justiﬁed: θi(a) and θj(a) differs
∀

only in situations where agent i connects to agent j and/or agent j connects to agent i, which

happens with a very small probability when there is a large population and agents randomly form

links with others. In fact, the approximation is exact if we consider a continuum population of

agents because each individual agent becomes inﬁnitesimal. In what follows, we drop the agent
index and simply write θ(a) for all i. Note that we intentionally use the same symbol θ for the

system state, namely the fraction of infected agents, to denote the probability that the formed

link connects to an infected agent. This is because, again, these two quantities are equal due to

the law of large numbers in the random matching setting.

C. Solution concept

The long-term utilities having been deﬁned, the link formation game with infections is clear:

each agent is a player in the game, which chooses a link formation strategy to maximize its

own long-term utility. Nash equilibrium (NE) is the most commonly used solution concept in

game theory. However, NE is inadequate in the considered game since the game is not static

and the system state evolves over time depending on the strategies chosen by the players. In

this paper, we adopt conjectural (Nash) equilibrium (CE), which is a reﬁnement of NE, as the

solution concept. CE is deﬁned as follows:

Deﬁnition 1. A tuple

a∗, θ∗

, where a∗ is a link formation strategy proﬁle and θ∗ is the

h

i

conjectured system state, is a CE if starting with any θ0 > 0, the following two conditions

are satisﬁed:

i = arg maxai UH (ai, a∗
1) a∗ is a Nash equilibrium under the conjectured system state, i.e. a∗
2) The conjecture is asymptotically correct, i.e. limt→∞ θt = θ∗ when the nodes adopt a∗.

−i|

θ∗)

Condition 1 states that the agents are playing the game as if the system had converged to

the conjectured state even though the actual real-time system state may be different from the

conjectured state. Condition 2 states that when the agents adopt the strategies derived based

on Condition 1, the system indeed will eventually converge to the conjectured state. Therefore,

the conjecture is realized. Conditions 1 and 2 together ensure the consistency of the system

dynamics and the solution concept.

IV. EPIDEMICS UNDER A FIXED STRATEGY

Before we study the stochastic epidemic network formed by strategic agents, we ﬁrst analyze

the epidemic propagation if the agents are non-strategic and following a ﬁxed strategy. This

analysis will be used for the comparison with the strategic case. In particular, we will focus on

a symmetric action proﬁle in which agents adopt the same action, i.e. ai = a,

i.

∀

A. Stationary distribution

The state of the system at any time is characterized by the fraction θt of infected agents among

all agents. The evolution of θt depends on the strategy adopted by the agents, the infection rate β,

the curing rate δ as well as the initial state of the system θ0. It is obvious that if the system starts

with an initial state θ0 = 0, namely there are zero infected agents, then no matter what strategies

are adopted by the agents, the system will remain in the state of zero infection. Therefore, it is

more interesting to study the non-trivial case where θ0 > 0. We focus on the impact of agent

strategy on the system state in this subsection and henceforth write θt(a) as a function of the

symmetric strategy a.

The system is said to be stationary if θt(a) becomes time-invariant. The stationary infection

distribution reﬂects how the epidemic evolves in the long run. We simply drop the time superscript

in the stationary distribution notation θ(a). It turns out that in the considered stochastic link

formation setting, there exists a critical number of links such that if agents form fewer than

the critical number of links, the epidemic eventually extinguishes, i.e. the stationary distribution

θ(a) = 0; otherwise, there is a positive infection probability.

the probability it is in the infected state at any time, which is

θ(a) =

There are two solutions of the above equation given any ﬁnite a. One is θ(a) = 0 and the other

solution gives the probability of nodes being in the infected state and it is differentiable to a

βa . Notice that only when a > δ

threshold ac, where two solutions meet. At the threshold, the solution is not differentiable. For

a < ac, the only meaningful solution is θ(a) = 0, which means that all nodes are uninfected in

the long-run. To see that the system indeed converges, consider the system dynamics given the

symmetric strategy a. For any θ > 0, the change in θ in a small time interval dt is

dθ > 0. Thus, the system must converge to θ∗. If a < ac, then for any θ > 0, dθ < 0, which
means that the system converges to θ∗ = 0.

Proposition 1 states that forming more links with other agents increases the infection prob-

ability of the system as a whole. Moreover, there is a critical value of the number of links,

which is important for preventing infection in the long-run. The result of Proposition 1 indeed is

equivalent to the classic result in the SIS literature, which establishes the existence of a critical

effective infection rate (i.e. β/δ). This is stated in Corollary 1.

Corollary 1. For a given network degree a, there exists a critical effective infection rate υc = 1/a

such that for all υ

υc, θ(υ) = 0, and for all υ > υc, θ(υ) = 1

Remark: If W

≤

ac, then the epidemic will always die out even if agents are strategically

deciding their link formation actions since agents will form no more than W links. This is the

trivial case which we will not study. In the remainder of this paper, we assume that W > ac.

B. Optimal protection

To reduce the infection probability, the network operator may choose to immunize a fraction

of agents at an immunization cost. We assume that immunization is perfect, namely immunized

agents do not get infected and hence will not infect other agents in the network. Suppose the

network operator can choose to immunize a fraction (1

[0, 1] of all agents in the network

at the cost of γ

(1

η) where γ is the unit time immunization cost. Without loss of generality,

·

−

the unit cost to the network operator due to infection is assumed to be 1. Hence, if the infection

level is θ, then the infection cost is θ. The total cost (in the stationary state) of the network

operator is thus D(a, η) = θ(a, η) + γ(1

η) where θ depends on the ﬁxed strategy a and the

immunization strategy η. Clearly θ < η since at most η fraction of agents can be infected. The

Proposition 2 states that if the immunization is too costly (i.e. γ > 1), then the optimal strategy

is to immunize no agents (i.e. 1

η = 0). If immunization is not too costly, the optimal strategy

is to immunize a fraction (1

−
δ
βa) of agents depending on the ﬁxed strategy a. Moreover, as
long as η < 1, the optimal strategy does not depend on the immunization cost so even if η is

−

small, it is not optimal to immunize all agents. This is because by immunizing a sufﬁciently

large fraction of the agents, the epidemic can already die out. Therefore, it is not necessary to

immunize all agents at additional costs.

C. System efﬁciency and social optimum

Suppose that instead of deploying an immunization strategy, the network operator can control

the link formation strategy of the agents. Obviously, there is a tradeoff when the utility of link

formation is involved: forming fewer links reduces the infection level of the system but also

decreases the utility that agents can obtain. The objective of the network operator is thus to

determine the optimal strategy that maximizes the system efﬁciency, which is deﬁned as the

average utility per capita in the stationary distribution, denoted by E(a). Speciﬁcally, E(a) can

be computed as E(a) = (1

−

θ(a))u(a). The network operator’s problem is to solve aOP T =

arg maxa E(a). Denote the social optimum by EOP T . The proposition below characterizes the

13

optimal solution.

and hence E(a) is decreasing in [ac,

is maximized at a = ac and E(ac) = u(ac).

Proposition 3 states that the threshold number of links eliminates infection in the long run

and at the same time also maximizes the system efﬁciency.

V. EPIDEMICS WITH STRATEGIC AGENTS

In the previous section, we studied the epidemic propagation, the immunization mechanism

and the system efﬁciency when agents are non-strategic and following a ﬁxed strategy. In this

section, we will show that tremendously different results emerge when agents are strategic who

try to maximize their own expected long-term utility by deciding the number of links to form.

A. Conjectural equilibrium (no observation of state state)

In this subsection, we study the case that agents do not observe the system state at any moment

in time. Since the information set of agents is the same across time, we use the conjectural

equilibrium (CE), deﬁned in Section III.C, as the solution concept. We start with a more explicit

expression of the agent’s long-term utility. By performing the integral operation on (1), the

long-term utilities are simpliﬁed to

UH (ai, a−i) =

1
ρ + βi(a)

(u(a) + βi(a)Ui(ai, a−i))

UL(ai, a−i) =

δ
ρ + δ

UL(ai, a−i)

(7)

(8)

Substituting UL(ai, a−i) into the ﬁrst equation, we obtain

UH (ai, a−i) =

ρ + δ
ρ

u(ai)
ρ + δ + βθ(a)ai

14

(9)

In CE, a∗

i is the best response to other agents’ equilibrium strategies, i.e. a∗

i = arg maxai UH(ai, a∗
i ).
Moreover, the conjecture has to be consistent with the reality. Theorem 1 establishes the existence

and uniqueness of the CE.

Theorem 1. The link formation game admits a unique CE. Moreover, the CE is symmetric,

namely aCE

i = aCE,

i where aCE > ac is the unique solution of

(10)

Proof. We consider two cases depending on the value of θ below.

(1) Suppose in the equilibrium, we have θ > 0. Then, for any θ > 0, we prove that there is a

unique maximizer a∗

i (θ). To prove this, take the ﬁrst-order derivative on the objective function,

which is

H(ai) =

ρ + δ
ρ

·

u′(ai)(ρ + δ + βθai)

−
(ρ + δ + βθai)2

u(ai)βθ

(11)

Let the numerator function be f (ai) = u′(ai)(ρ + δ + βθai)
u(ai)βθ for the ease of exposition.
Clearly f (0) > 0 and f (M) < 0. Moreover, f ′(ai) = u′′(ai)(ρ + δ + βθai) < 0. Therefore, there
a > a∗
exists a unique a∗
i .
∀
(0, 1), which is the

i , f ′(a∗
(0, M) of UH (ai) for θ

As a result, there is a unique maximizer a∗

(0, M) such that f ′(ai) > 0,

i ) = 0 and f ′(ai) < 0,

a < a∗
∀

i ∈

i ∈

solution of

u(a)
u′(a) −

a =

ρ + δ
βθ

(12)

Because every agent faces the same system state θ, this proves that, if an equilibrium exists,

agents’ strategies must be symmetric. We henceforth drop the agent index and write the sym-

metric strategy as a∗(θ).

Because strategies are symmetric in equilibrium, we can then apply the result of Proposition

1 to compute the stationary distribution. Since we have assumed that θ > 0, equilibrium must

satisfy two conditions

θ = 1

δ
βa∗(θ)

−

and

a∗(θ) > ac

(13)

15

(14)

Substituting θ into the ﬁrst-order condition, we have

u(a)
u′(a) −

a =

ρ + δ
δ
β
a

−

To prove that there is a unique solution to the above equation, consider the monotonicity of

both sides of the equation with respect to a. Clearly, the right-hand side (LHS) is a decreasing
function in a for a > ac = δ

β . The ﬁrst-order derivative of the left-hand side function is

u′(a)u′(a)

u(a)u′′(a)

−
(u′(a))2

1 = −

u(a)u′′(a)
(u′(a))2 > 0

−

Therefore, the right-hand side (RHS) is increasing in a. Moreover, notice that as a

(15)

ac, LHS

→

must be smaller than RHS while as a

M, LHS must be greater than RHS. Therefore, there

must exist a unique solution a∗

(ac, M). This solution satisﬁes the two conditions of CE.

→

∈

(2) Suppose in the equilibrium, we have θ = 0. In this case, the utility becomes

UH(ai, a−i) =

u(ai)
ρ

(16)

which monotonically increases with ai. Hence, each agent chooses ai as large as possible.

However, if ai goes over ac, infection does not extinguish, thereby contradicting the assumption

that θ = 0. Therefore, θ = 0 cannot be a CE.

Theorem 1 states a result that is in stark contrast with existing works on epidemic networks

with ﬁxed degrees: when agents are strategic in forming links, infection never extinguishes in

equilibrium for any value of β and δ (hence any value of the effective spreading rate) because

the number of links that the agents are willing to form is always larger than the corresponding

critical value ac(β, δ). Proposition 4 further reveals the dependency of the CE on the system

parameters.

Proposition 4. aCE increases with ρ, δ and decreases with β.

Proof. Let aCE

16

Proposition 4 can be intuitively understood. (1) A larger ρ means greater discounting of future

utilities. Therefore, agents have incentives to form more links to reap more instantaneous utilities

since future utilities are less valued. (2) A larger β means faster infection. Since forming more

links exposes the agent to more infection threats when β is larger, agents have incentives to

reduce the number of links formed. (3) A larger δ means faster curing. Thus the infection

threats become smaller when δ is larger because the agents can recover more quickly.

B. System dynamics and convergence (observation of the system state)

In the previous subsection, we studied the case that agents do not observe the actual system

state θt at any time t. In such situations, conjectural equilibrium is a reasonable solution concept

in which agents form conjecture about the converged system state. In this subsection, we study

the case that agents observe the system state θt and act upon this observation to maximize their

long-term utilities. We are interested in the convergence of the system: whether it converges and,

if yes, where it converges to, and how fast it converges.

At any time t, each agent observes the current state θt and determines the link formation

action at based on this information. Due to the assumption of bounded rationality, at is the best

response to θt, i.e. a∗(θt) = arg maxa UH(a
|

θt) =

UH (a
|

θt) is

θt), where UH(a
|

ρ + δ
ρ

µ(a)
ρ + δ + βθta

(17)

which can be derived based on our previous analysis. Note that all healthy agents take the same

action a∗(θt) since agents are homogenous and face the same system state. Moreover, a∗(θt) is

the solution of

u(at)
u′(at) −

at =

ρ + δ
βθt

The system evolution therefore can be characterized by the following differential equation

dθt =

θtδdt + (1

−

−

θt)βθta∗(θt)dt

(18)

(19)

In the above system dynamics equation, the ﬁrst term θtδdt is the population mass of infected

agents that are cured in a small time interval dt. The second term (1

θt)βθta∗(θt)dt is the

−

population mass of healthy agents that are infected in a small interval dt. Notice the difference

between (4) and (19): in (4), the link formation strategy is ﬁxed over time whereas in (19), the

link formation strategy is the best response to the current system state.

Theorem 2. The system dynamics deﬁned by (19) converges to θCE starting from any θ0 > 0.

Proof. The best response a∗(θt) is determined by equation (18). Because LHS of (18) is mono-

tonically increasing with a, a∗(θt) is decreasing with θt. Now consider the system dynamics.

Equation (19) can be rewritten as

17

dθt = θt[(1

θt)βa∗(θt)

δ]dt

−

(20)

0, what matters is

We are interested in the sign of dθt for different values of θt. Since θt

we show that there exists θ∗

(0, 1) such that f (θ∗) = 0.

θ∗ must satisfy the following set of equations

δ = 0,

and

u(a∗)
u′(a∗) −

a∗ =

(21)

Rearranging the ﬁrst equation to get θ∗ in terms of a∗ and substituting θ∗ in the second equation

gives

u(a∗)
u′(a∗) −

a∗ =

ρ + δ
δ
β
a∗

−

(22)

Notice that the above is the same equation of determining the CE aCE. Therefore a∗ > ac
(0, 1). Since f (θ∗) = 0 and f (θt) is decreasing, we know that f (θt) < 0 for
and hence θ∗

θt

(θ∗, 1) and f (θt) > 0 for θt

(0, θ∗). This means that θt decreases when θt

(θ∗, 1)

and increases when θt

(0, θ∗). Therefore, the system converges to the unique steady state

∈

θ∗ = θCE.

Theorem 2 states that the best response dynamics leads the system to a converged state which

corresponds to the conjectural equilibrium. It is worth highlighting the differences between CE

and best response again: in CE, every agent does not observe the system state at any time and

acts based on the conjectured system state. As a result, the link formation strategy does not

change over time. In teh best response dynamics, every agent observes the (same) system state

and optimizes its strategy against the current system state. Therefore, the link formation strategy

evolves over time. Nevertheless, Theorem 2 proves that, with or without the knowledge of the

system state, the system converges to the same state in which infection never extinguishes, which

is signiﬁcantly different from a system where agents are obedient and interact on ﬁxed network

topologies.

The proposition below provides bounds on the rate of convergence.

Proposition 5. For any initial system state θ0 > θCE (or θ0 < θCE),
time at which θT decreases to θCE + ǫ , θǫ (or increases to θCE

Since ln θt is monotonically increasing in (0, 1), θ0 evolving to θǫ is equivalent to ln θ0 evolving to

ln θǫ. Because we have shown that (1

δ = 0, the absolute rate of change

C. Optimal protection

Now, we study the optimal immunization strategy for epidemic networks with strategic agents.

Again, the network operator chooses to immunize a fraction (1

η)

[0, 1] of the agents at a cost

−

∈

of γ

(1

η). Different from the case where agents adopt a ﬁxed strategy, the immunization strategy

·

−

of the network operator now inﬂuences how the strategic agents choose their link formation action

and hence the total cost. The total cost is therefore D(η) = θ(a(η), η) + γ(1

η). The next

−

proposition characterizes the impact of the immunization strategy on the total cost.

Proposition 6. Assume u′′′(a) < 0 and W

(γ1, γ2), then there exists η∗(γ) such that D(η) is decreasing in [0, η∗(γ)] and then

increasing in [η∗(γ), 1]. Moreover, η∗(γ) is increasing in c.

Proof. The infection level θ depends on η as follows: θ = η

(25)

Using similar arguments as in Proposition 4, we can show that a∗ is decreasing in η. Because

19

∀

a∗ is decreasing in θ, we have that θ is monotonically increasing in η, i.e. θ′(η) > 0,

η. Next,

we prove that θ′′(η) > 0. Because (1) θ(0) = 0 and (2) θ and η is one-to-one mapping, it is
equivalent to prove that η′′(θ) < 0 where η = θ + δ

βa∗(θ) . Thus, it further is equivalent to prove

that

θ2 > θ1, the following is true

∀

βθ , we can instead prove

f (a∗

f (a∗
2)

<

(26)

(27)

Because f (0) = 0 and f ′(a) > 0, it is equivalent to prove that f ′′(a) > 0. To see this is true,

f ′(a) =

and

u′(a)u′(a)

(u′(a))3

2u(a)(u′′(a))2

−

(28)

(29)

Therefore, if u′′′(a) < 0, then f ′′(a) > 0. This proves that θ′′(η) > 0. Hence, θ′(η) > 0 is an

increasing function of η. Let limη→0 θ′(η) = γ1 and limη→1 θ′(η) = γ2. Clearly γ1 < γ2.

Notice D′(η) = θ′(η)

γ. If γ < γ1, then D′(η) > 0,

η. This means that D(η) is increasing

−

∀

in η. If γ > γ2, then D′(η) < 0,
(γ1, γ2),
then there must exist η∗ such that θ′(η∗) = γ. This means that D(η) is decreasing in [0, η∗] and

η. This means that D(η) is decreasing in η. If γ

∈

∀

then increasing in [η∗, 1]. Finally, it is easy to see that η∗(γ) is increasing in γ.

Proposition 6 states an important result regarding the optimal protection deployment. Specif-

ically, the optimal immunization strategy depends on the relative cost of immunization and can

be categorized into three regions. If the immunization cost is sufﬁciently low (i.e. γ

γ1), then

≤

the optimal strategy is immunizing all agents in the network. If the immunization cost is too

high (i.e. γ

γ2), then the optimal strategy is immunizing no agents in the network. If the

≥

immunization cost is neither too low nor too high, there is a unique optimal level of protection

1

η∗(γ) that depends on the cost γ.

−
The optimal protection when agents are strategic is signiﬁcantly different from that when

agents follow a ﬁxed link formation strategy. In the latter case, no matter what ﬁxed strategies

20

the agents adopt and what the immunization cost is, immunizing all agents is never the optimal

protection from the network operator’s perspective. This is because immunizing all agents is

unnecessary since as long as the immunization is sufﬁciently strong, infection will extinguish.

However, in the former case, immunizing all agents is indeed the optimal protection strategy when

the cost is low. This is because, as shown in Theorem 1, no matter how strong the immunization

is, strategic agents have incentives to form more than the critical number of links and hence,

infection never extinguishes. Therefore, if the immunization cost is sufﬁciently small, then it

is optimal for the network operator to proactively eliminate infection through immunizing all

agents. In Section VII, we will further elaborate these points through numerical results and show

that ignoring the strategic nature of agents may lead to signiﬁcantly higher system costs.

D. Price of anarchy

In this subsection, we study the system efﬁciency when agents are strategic. The price of

anarchy (POA) is an important game theoretical concept that measures how the system efﬁciency

degrades due to selﬁsh behavior of the agents. PoA is deﬁned as the ratio between the social

optimum and the worst equilibrium efﬁciency. Hence, PoA is always no less than 1 and the

larger PoA, the larger efﬁciency loss. Since there is a unique equilibrium in our problem, PoA

is simply P oA = EOP T /ECE. Recall that for a given link formation strategy a, the system

efﬁciency is deﬁned as E(a) = (1

θ(a))u(a) = δu(a)
βa .

−

Before we proceed, we note that there is a trivial bound on PoA: since it must be aCE

(ac, W )

∈

and E(a) is decreasing in [ac, W ] according to the proof of Proposition 3, the PoA must satisfy

P oA <

EOP T
E(W )

(30)

If W is close to ac, then the PoA bound is already very tight. In the next proposition, we consider

the case when W is at least twice of ac.

Proposition 7. Let a† , δ+√δ2+ρδ
holds.

acu(a†) > 1. If W > a†, then the following

• If u′(a†) < u(a†)
• If u′(a†) > u(a†)
• If u′(a†) = u(a†)

2a†+ρβ−1 , then P oA < κ.
2a†+ρβ−1 , then P oA > κ.
2a†+ρβ−1 , then P oA = κ.

First, we prove that g(a) is increasing in the range of [ac, M). This is easy to see because

g′(a) = (u′(a))2−u(a)u′′(a)

(ac, a†). If g(a†) < f (a†), then

Proposition 7 shows how close aCE is to ac depends on the speciﬁc form of the utility function,
speciﬁcally, the slope of the utility function at a particular point a†. If the utility function increases

slowly enough after forming a certain number of a† links, then agents have incentives to form less

than a† links in equilibrium. This is intuitive because the increased infection threat outweighs

the increased utility by forming more links. Otherwise, agents have incentives to form more
than a† links in equilibrium. Moreover, any utility function that satisﬁes u′(a†) = u(a†)
2a†+ρβ−1 must
have the equilibrium be exactly a†, regardless of the value of u(x) at other points than a†. This

analysis leads to the bounds on the PoA: the PoA is upper bounded (i.e. efﬁciency loss is lower

bounded) by a constant if the instantaneous utility of forming more links increases sufﬁciently

slowly whereas PoA is lower bounded (i.e. efﬁciency loss is upper bounded) by a constant if

the instantaneous utility of forming more links increases sufﬁciently fast.

VI. HETEROGENOUS AGENTS

In the previous sections, we assumed that agents are homogenous. Many of our results can be

extended to the case of heterogenous agents. In this section, we consider a heterogenous system

where agents are different in terms of the curing rates and show that conjectural equilibrium

exists in this case. In particular, we assume that there are K types of agents, indexed by the set

22

=

1, 2, ..., K

. The curing rate for type k agents is δk and the fraction of type k agents is

K

First, we characterize the stationary distribution when the link formation strategy (a1, ..., aK)

is adopted in which all type k agents adopt the constant strategy ak.

Recall that when agents are homogeneous, there is a single threshold number of links that

is important for determining whether infection persists or extinguishes (see Proposition 1). In

the case of heterogeneous agents, the result is analogous. Since the link formation action is

characterized by a vector instead of a scalar value, the threshold becomes a hyperplane. It is

easy to see that when K = 1, Proposition 7 reduces to Proposition 1. Corollary 2 below is the

extension to Corollary 1, which again resembles the classic result in the SIS literature.

VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we provide numerical results to illustrate the various aspects of our framework

and highlight the importance of understanding the strategic link formation behavior for designing

effective protection mechanisms.

First, we investigate the steady state behavior for both the ﬁxed link formation strategy and

the strategic link formation strategy (under system parameters β = 0.1, δ = 0.3, ρ = 0.05).

The upper plot in Figure 1 shows how the system state evolves over time for different ﬁxed

link formation strategies. Depending on the actions, the fraction of infected agents converges to

different values. The lower plot in Figure 1 further illustrates the converged system state as a

function of the link formation actions. As predicted by Proposition 1, there exists a threshold

value of a such that the infection dies out if the link formation action is below the threshold.

Figure 2 shows how the system dynamics changes when agents are strategic. The upper plot

shows the evolution of the system state for various curing rates δ. In each case, the system

converges to a positive fraction of infected agents. This fraction decreases as the curing rate

increases. The lower plot shows the link formation action a∗ in the steady state as a function

of δ. When the curing rate is larger, agents tend to form more links since infection is a smaller

threat. However, the number of links that strategic agents are willing to form is always larger

than the critical number in the non-strategic case.

Next, we show that different immunization protection schemes are needed when agents are

strategic (β = 0.1, δ = 0.3, ρ = 0.05). Figure 3 illustrates how the total cost D varies as the

immunization scheme changes for various values of the unit immunization cost γ. To enable

direct comparisons, the action is ﬁxed at a = 4.47, which is the same as the steady state action

for strategic agents when δ = 0.3 (see Figure 2). As we can see, when the unit immunization

cost is large (γ > 1), the optimal scheme immunizes zero agents (i.e. η = 1) whereas when the
unit immunization cost is small (γ < 1), the optimal scheme has η = δ
the speciﬁc value of γ. Thus, for a given ﬁxed strategy, only two schemes (η = 1 or η = δ

βa = 0.67 regardless of
βa) can
be the optimal scheme. Moreover, it is never optimal to immunize all agents in all cases. This

is what Proposition 2 predicted. On the other hand, when agents are strategic, immunizing all

agents is actually the optimal protection when the unit immunization cost is sufﬁciently low, as

shown in Figure 4. The ﬁgure also shows that depending on the speciﬁc value of γ, the optimal

η is different. When the unit immunization cost is too large, the optimal scheme is to immunize

zero agents.

The above comparison demonstrates the signiﬁcant importance of understanding the strate-

gic behavior of agents. Suppose that the system designer observes an average degree of 4.47

when there is no immunization protection and wrongly believes that agents are not strategic.

Consequently, the designer will use an immunization scheme η = 0.67 when γ = 0.3 in order

to minimize the total cost. However, since agents are actually strategic, the correct optimal

immunization scheme should be η = 0. This leads to a signiﬁcant performance loss. Using the

curve for γ = 0.3 in Figure 4, we can compute the increased cost, which is more than 30%

than that if the correct immunization scheme is used. Figure 5 illustrates the total cost difference

for various values of the immunization cost. The cost incurred by using the ﬁxed scheme is the

closest to the optimal cost when γ is around 0.5. This is because the ﬁxed scheme happens to be

close to the optimal scheme. However, when γ is either larger or smaller, signiﬁcant performance

loss is incurred due to lack of understanding of the strategic behavior of agents. When γ is small,

the total system cost can increase by more than 3 times.

Fig. 7. Efﬁciency loss due to strategic behavior.

Finally, we investigate the achievable system efﬁciency. When agents are non-strategic, the

system design can prescribe link formation actions to agents to maximize the system efﬁciency.

Figure 6 shows the achievable efﬁciency as a function of the link formation action (β = 0.1, δ =

0.3, ρ = 0.05). As predicted in Proposition 3, the efﬁciency is maximized when the agents take

the critical value ac = 3. When agents are strategic, they tend to form higher than the critical

number of links, thereby incurring efﬁciency loss. This is illustrated in Figure 7 for various

values of the curing rate δ.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we studied the epidemic dynamics in networks endogenously formed by strategic

agents. We showed that such networks exhibit signiﬁcantly different features than networks that

are exogenously given. An important lesson learned from our analysis is that ignoring the strategic

nature of agents in forming links may result in signiﬁcantly increased system cost. Therefore,

protection mechanisms that previously apply to non-strategic networks need to be re-designed

and adjusted for networks formed by strategic agents.

Although this paper provides a number of key insights for designing network formed by

strategic agents, we are keenly aware that there are also limitations in the current model, which

tends to be simplistic and stylized. For instance, the current model focuses on only the average

behavior of agents using an mean-ﬁeld approximation. When there are only a limited number

of agents who may be interacting with topological constraints, different formalism and analysis

 
 
 
 
28

are required to take into account the identity of agents. In the current model, agents are strategic

only in forming links. Another important future work direction is to understand the epidemic

dynamics when agents jointly choose link formation and security investment actions.
