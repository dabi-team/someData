Understanding motivations and character-
istics of ﬁnancially-motivated cybercrim-
inals:

Revisiting theoretical approaches through
the lens of contemporary practitioner ex-
periences

Background: Cyber oﬀences, such as hacking, malware creation and distribu-
tion, and online fraud, present a substantial threat to organizations attempting
to safeguard their data and information. By understanding the evolving char-
acteristics and motivations of individuals involved in these activities, and the
threats that they may pose, cyber security practitioners will be better placed to
understand and assess current threats to their systems and the range of socio-
technical mitigations that may best reduce these. Aim: The reported work-
in-progress aims to explore the extent to which ﬁndings from prior academic
literature regarding the characteristics and motivations of oﬀenders engaging in
ﬁnancially-motivated, cyber-dependent crime are supported by the contempo-
rary experiences and perspectives of practitioners currently working in the cyber
crime ﬁeld. Method: A targeted, online survey was developed consisting of
both closed and open-ended questions relating to current cyber threats and the
characteristics and motivations of oﬀenders engaged in these activities. Sixteen
practitioners working in law enforcement-related domains in the cyber crime ﬁeld
completed the survey, providing a combination of qualitative and quantitative
data for analysis. Results: Findings demonstrated support for three charac-
teristics previously highlighted in prior research (younger age, being male, and
greater computer use) and multiple motivations, with ﬁnancial gain and a feeling
of power and status being the most common. Several nuances in characteristics
and motivations were also considered by practitioners related to the particular
type of cybercrime engaged in, and how these various aspects appear to be evolv-
ing due to the increasing commercialization of ready-to-use toolkits, the growth
of cyber-crime as a service, and the involvement of organized crime groups and
others in malevolent cyber activity. Conclusions: The reported work provides
key insight into the views, perspectives and experiences of current practitioners
in the cyber crime ﬁeld, overlaying theoretical concepts and ﬁndings from prior
academic literature with elicited perspectives from law enforcement practition-
ers. As a work-in-progress, it is intended that further work will be undertaken
to consider additional data sources that may further validate these ﬁndings.

Background

Cyber oﬀences such as hacking, malware creation and distribution, and online
fraud present a substantial threat to organizations and individuals attempting to
safeguard their data and information. Understanding the evolving characteristics
and motivations of individuals involved in these activities can help practition-
ers attempting to disrupt or counter cybercriminal activity. Although there is
a reasonable body of work that investigates the various motivations and char-
acteristics of cybercriminal oﬀenders, the constantly evolving nature of cyber
threats and those involved means that it is vital to revisit prior work in rela-
tion to whether previous ﬁndings accurately reﬂect the current experiences of
contemporary practitioners working in the ﬁeld.

This work in progress, therefore, aims to contribute to current understanding
of the motivations and characteristics of those involved in cybercriminal activ-
ities and the threats that they may pose from a cyber security perspective in
order to inform the future development of socio-technical mitigations that can
address these evolving threats. Speciﬁcally, this paper overviews the ﬁndings of
prior research regarding the characteristics and motivations of those involved in
cybercriminal activities and explores the extent to which these ﬁndings are re-
ﬂected in the current perspectives and experiences of practitioners working in the
cyber crime domain. As a work in progress, it is intended that additional data
sources will be considered in future work (e.g., the analysis of current case data
or data gathered from relevant darknet market (DNM) communities) to examine
the extent to which these motivations and characteristics may be reﬂected in
other datasets.

Related Literature and Theoretical Ap-
proaches

Previous work has investigated the role of a number of characteristics of cyber
oﬀenders, including age, gender, Internet usage, and degree of self-control. Al-
though there is some variation in ﬁndings, overall research suggests that younger
adults (e.g., those in their late teens and twenties) and males are more likely to
be involved in cyber criminal activities (e.g., [18, 43, 23, 41, 38, 35, 26, 27]),
with some suggestion that such individuals also demonstrate higher education
levels [18, 43] and spend more time online (e.g., [27, 9, 36, 8]).

The various factors that may motivate individuals to engage in cyber criminal

activities have also been explored, with motivations ranging from ﬁnancial reward
[18, 43, 26, 33, 19, 15], curiosity (e.g., [43, 41, 44]), and entertainment [41,
33, 19, 44, 14] to addiction [43, 41, 26, 19, 21], individual vengeance [18, 41,
26, 33, 19, 15, 44, 14, 22], the pursuit of power or status [43, 26, 15, 44, 25],
ideology [43, 16] and learning, immersion and intellectual challenge [43, 41].

Unfortunately, research in this area is often constrained by methodological
limitations, predominantly due to diﬃculties in accessing oﬀender populations
and other forms of data and a heavy reliance on self-report measures and self-
selected samples, which continues to be an issue in many human-focused re-
search ﬁelds (see [34] for a review). Quantitative data is typically analyzed
using regression approaches to determine which factors may predict involvement
in cybercriminal activities (e.g., [9, 19, 25, 17]). While this analytic approach is
sound, online surveys often utilize student samples (e.g., [8]) or focus on younger
demographics (see [43] for a review), which can present limitations with regards
to the generalizability of ﬁndings across wider population groups.

More recently, work has scraped forums or utilized readily available datasets
(e.g., DNM Archives, see [4]) alongside deploying big data analytics (e.g., data
mining, machine learning) to provide a mechanism to continue to improve and
develop current understanding of cybercriminal behavior (e.g., [7]). However,
papers using scraped data commonly focus on market dynamics and the impact
of law enforcement interventions rather than oﬀender motivations or character-
istics. In order to minimize the various limitations of these diﬀering approaches,
the triangulation of multiple data sources and integration of theoretically-based
predictions represents the optimal, albeit more resource intensive, approach.

A range of theoretical approaches from psychology, criminology and sociol-
ogy have been applied to understand the factors that underpin the behavior,
motivations and characteristics of cyber criminals, with a particular focus on
Neutralization Theory [40], Self-Control Theory [30], Social-Cognitive Theory
[3], Routine Activity Theory [5], and Theory of Planned Behavior [2].

At the individual level, Neutralization Theory (NT; [40]) focuses on how in-
dividuals perceive and consider the potential impact of their criminal activities,
and the way in which they may distort these perceptions in order to make their
activities more morally acceptable. For instance, if individuals believe that en-
gaging in hacking is a morally unethical behavior, but they engage in this activity,
then in order to reduce the resultant conﬂict between their moral perceptions
and their behaviors, they can either stop engaging in the behavior altogether
(i.e., no longer engage in hacking activities), or they can adjust their attitudes
and thoughts to correspond with their behavior (e.g., considering that hack-
ing is not hurting anyone directly and so it must be okay, thus making it a

morally acceptable activity). Neutralization theory has been applied to hacking
(e.g., [28]) and digital piracy activities (e.g., [29]), with ﬁve primary mechanisms
highlighted by which this may occur: (1) denial of responsibility (e.g., “I had no
other choice”), (2) denial of injury (e.g., “it doesn’t hurt anyone”), (3) denial
of victim (e.g., “the victim deserves it in some way”), (4) condemnation of the
condemners (e.g., “victims are hypocrites”), and (5) appeal to higher loyalties
(e.g., the behavior was warranted to achieve a higher purpose).

Self-Control Theory of Crime (SCTC) also considers the inﬂuence of individ-
ual characteristics, considering that individuals often engage in criminal activities
due to failure in their ability to eﬀectively control their behavior [30]. Self-control
is considered a trait psychological characteristic linked to the ability to avoid and
resist temptation (see [11]). Individuals low in self-control are considered to be
more impulsive, take greater risks, and fail to adequately consider the long-
term consequences of their actions. This trait has been linked to cybercriminal
activities, such as downloading illegal content [27, 9, 13, 32].

Other approaches, such as Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; [3]) focus on the
inﬂuence of the wider environment on engagement in cybercriminal activities.
For instance, Social Cognitive Theory suggests that individuals learn how to
behave in a particular environment based on observing the actions of those
around them and the resultant consequences and outcomes of the behaviors
that they observe. It is proposed that this social learning process occurs through
engagement with particular role models within an individual’s environment, such
as observing the behavior of family members. It can also occur via exposure to
mass-media content or particular social norms and activities linked to speciﬁc
geographical locations or communities. This process may not only inﬂuence
what types of behavior an individual considers to be socially acceptable, but can
also lead to direct learning and skill acquisition related to the actual ability to
engage in particular types of online activities. For instance, attitudes to digital
piracy have been linked to association with deviant peers and the perception that
important others wanted or expected the individual to engage in these activities
[10, 20, 24]. Social-ecological approaches to deviant online activities, such as
cyber bullying, also highlight the potential role of these various social factors in
inﬂuencing individual behavior [6].

Routine Activities Theory (RAT; [5]) similarly considers the wider environ-
ment in inﬂuencing engagement in cybercriminal activities, referring to three
main elements that must align in order for a crime to occur: (1) the existence
of an attractive target (e.g., credit card details stored in a particular location)
(2) the presence of a motivated oﬀender (e.g., an individual who becomes aware
of this data or actively seeks it out), and (3) the lack of a capable guardian
In this way, the existence of
(e.g., a lack of suﬃcient technical protections).

a suﬃciently attractive target and the use of poor protective mechanisms can,
in turn, inﬂuence the behavior, characteristics and potential motivations of an
oﬀender to commit a particular crime (e.g., a particular activity may represent
an intellectual challenge, or poor protections may mean that complex technical
skills are not necessary).

Finally, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; [2]) overlaps with many of the
aspects discussed above, considering three primary mechanisms through which
an individual’s intentions to engage in a particular behavior may be inﬂuenced:
(1) individuals attitudes towards a behavior, which represents how positively or
negatively they evaluate the behavior and those who engage in it, (2) perceived
social norms related to engaging in that behavior, and (3) the perceived ease of
engaging in the behavior (termed perceived behavioral control). Overall, the use
of the TPB as a framework to understand and change behavior has been sup-
ported in multiple domains, although eﬀects are generally found to be stronger
for intentions to engage in particular activities compared to actual behavioral
responses (see [39] for a review). Although the TPB has been predominantly
considered in relation to what factors inﬂuence engagement in secure online be-
havior, there has also been a very limited consideration of how these concepts
may apply to cybercriminal behaviors, such as hacking (e.g., [37]). Previous
research has also shown that the perceived likelihood of getting caught when
engaging in a cybercriminal activity can inﬂuence an individual’s attitudes. For
instance, Nandedkar and Midha [31] assessed the presence of optimism bias in
relation to music piracy and suggested that greater optimism with regards to
potential risks (i.e., an individual thinking that they were less likely to get caught
compared to other people) inﬂuenced resultant attitudes towards digital piracy.

Research Aims

The current study reports work in progress to examine the contemporary char-
acteristics and motivations of individuals engaged in cyber criminal activities. In
particular, it aims to explore the extent to which ﬁndings of prior research are
supported by the experiences and perspectives of practitioners currently work-
ing in the cyber crime ﬁeld, with a view to understanding current threats and
evolving motivations and characteristics of individuals involved in such activities.

A targeted survey approach is used to examine the experiences of individuals
working within law enforcement-related contexts (at either regional, national,
or international level), oﬀering a unique insight into the practical experiences
of individuals working with this oﬀender group. Our approach aims to overlay
theoretical concepts and ﬁndings from prior academic literature with elicited per-

spectives from law enforcement practitioners, with future work aiming to also
triangulate these ﬁndings with data gathered from DNM communities. Link-
ing these aspects provides a novel perspective on cybercriminal motivations and
characteristics that will provide a useful framework for developing appropriate
socio-technical interventions (e.g., diverting early stage oﬀenders to more pos-
itive outlets for their skills). The characteristics and motivations for cyber of-
fenders identiﬁed by prior literature and theoretical approaches are shown in
Table 1 and provide a basis for comparison with the views and experiences of
current practitioners working in the cyber crime ﬁeld. This allows us to explore
the following research question:

Research Question: To what extent do the perspectives of practitioners re-
garding the characteristics and motivations of cyber oﬀenders reﬂect themes
identiﬁed in current research literature?

Method

Survey Design

A targeted online survey was developed using the Qualtrics online survey platform
(qualtrics.com). The survey included a combination of closed and open-
ended questions and focused on participants’ views and experiences related to
the following aspects:

1. Current cyber threats: What participants considered the three most sig-
niﬁcant ﬁnancially-motivated cyber-crime threats to be (two open-response
questions).

2. Oﬀender characteristics: Whether participants felt that there were par-
ticular characteristics of cybercriminal oﬀenders and what these were (one
closed question based on speciﬁc characteristics identiﬁed in prior litera-
ture, with an open-response option for elaboration and additional charac-
teristics), whether they considered these characteristics to be changing,
and whether they considered these characteristics to diﬀer according to
diﬀerent cyber crime threats (two open-response questions).

3. Oﬀender motivations: The extent to which participants considered dif-
ferent factors to represent a motivation for becoming involved, or contin-
uing involvement, in cybercriminal activities (two closed questions based
on speciﬁc motivations identiﬁed in prior literature with each motivation
listed responded to on a scale of 1 (never a motivation) - 5 (almost always
a motivation) and an open-response option for elaboration and additional
characteristics), whether they considered these motivations to be chang-
ing, and whether they considered these motivations to diﬀer according to
diﬀerent cybercrime threats (two open-response questions).

The survey was circulated via email to relevant public and private sector
bodies focused on investigating cybercriminal activity and relevant practitioner
networks within the law enforcement community. This provided potential respon-
dents with information about the study, the contact details of the researchers,
and a weblink for those interested in participating. On accessing the survey,
potential respondents were presented with further detail on the research.
It
was made clear that the survey was voluntary and that participants were under
no obligation to complete it. The survey was also anonymous, with no iden-
tifying information collected and the data was accessed and analyzed solely by

members of the research team at the [removed for peer review]. Participants
provided informed consent by indicating that they were happy to proceed before
accessing the main survey. The research was granted ethical approval by the
relevant institutional review board. A copy of the survey is shown in the Ap-
pendix. The qualitative and quantitative data was analyzed in relation to the
primary oﬀender motivations and characteristics displayed in Table 1 to identify
the extent to which it supported these various concepts.

Participants

Sixteen participants completed the survey between November 2019 and January
2020. Of these, fourteen stated that they worked in the public sector, one in
the private sector, and one in both. Eleven participants worked in investigation
roles, four in intelligence roles and one in a management role, with the majority
(11 participants: 69%) working at a regional level. The remainder worked at
national or inter-national levels. The majority had worked in their role for at
least one year (10; 63%). Characteristics are also shown in tabular form in the
Appendix.

Results

What is the threat?

Participants were asked to list what they considered to be the top three most
signiﬁcant ﬁnancially motivated cybercrime threats in order of seriousness (loss
or damage). Overall, ransomware was considered to be the most signiﬁcant
threat, mentioned by eleven participants (69%; with 8 specifying it as their top
threat). However, although this provides an indication of how many participants
discussed this threat, the low sample size prevents any conclusions being drawn
based on quantitative data. Multiple other threats were also mentioned and
are shown in Table 2.
Interestingly, when describing their reasoning for the
identiﬁcation and ranking of these threats, participants highlighted the diﬀering
impact of oﬀender characteristics on such threats (e.g., the degree of technical
knowledge required), as well as intersections with factors likely to inﬂuence
motivations, such as the potential low likelihood of being caught and the relative
ease with which a crime can be committed. For instance, participant 2 stated
“phishing and compromise of accounts... This is a high volume, low-tech criminal

strategy that reaps high returns at low risk.
In a month I would see multiple
reports of this activity, and maybe one or fewer instances of ransomware/Trojan.
I rank Ransomware second as it requires greater tech knowledge and is harder
to deploy. However, it is likely to be signiﬁcantly more damaging in a single
incident. I rank Trojans as third threat as they require greater tech knowledge
than the other two, and I do not believe them to be as common.” Similarly,
in relation to carding, participant 6 highlighted that “suspects largely seem
to escape any law enforcement intervention. Massive ﬁnancial loss. Details
are available to buy with a little dark web knowledge”. Finally, participant 12
discussed the necessity to understand the interactions between these activities:
“Banks repeatedly list BEC as major crime in terms of ﬁnancial loss. However,
the data needed for the groundwork of these crimes are (I believe) built on
data and access gained through malware infections. Ransomware is the fall-
back position to make money from systems that have been compromised via
malware.”

Cyber oﬀender characteristics

Respondents were asked, based on their experience, whether they felt there
were particular characteristics of oﬀenders involved in cybercriminal activities.
Table 3 shows the cyber oﬀender characteristics that were referenced by at least
50% of respondents, namely age, gender and extent of computer use. The
remaining characteristics listed in the survey (e.g., education level, employment,
engagement in oﬄine crime, and personality) did not meet this threshold and
so were not supported by the majority of respondents.

When reasoning about their choices, participants highlighted the various nu-
ances, such as crime type, that may inﬂuence these characteristics. For example,
participant 14 stated “characteristics diﬀer depending on the type of cybercrime.
Cybercrime resulting in inconvenience can often be younger, more local oﬀend-
ers. Strongly acquisitively driven cybercrime is often more organized, typically
originating from overseas. . .
ransomware appears to be more technically ca-
pable oﬀenders directly involved (many are penetrative, manual attacks rather
than automated malware deployed by unskilled oﬀenders). Mandate fraud is less
technically demanding; are they simply buying compromise lists, or employing
(contracting to?) a cybercriminal to perform the compromise”, whilst partici-
pant 16 stated “I would suggest Ransomware is often part of an organized crime
group - but I have no experience of their characteristics. DDoS and Remote
Access Trojans are far more accessible, easy to setup and to deploy and more
likely to be the type of oﬀender characteristics I’ve mentioned.” Similarly, par-

ticipant 5 stated “the ﬁnancially motivated are not typical of the above and
quite often involved in organized criminality ” and participant 2 highlighted that
the “oﬀender proﬁle above is more likely to be involved in network intrusion. If
they can be recruited/exploited by nation state or OCG they may be involved
in ransomware/Trojan. I suspect that those involved in business email compro-
mise/phishing are not particularly technically proﬁcient.” This view was echoed
by participant 11, who suggested “maybe slightly older teenagers are manip-
ulated into Serious Organized Crime but they all begin at an early age” and
by participant 12: “BEC doesn’t require high end computer programming &
techical understanding (albeit highly skilled fraudsters once they have a person
‘on the hook’). . . Malware writes are mostly now coders for hire — good skills,
poor morality ”.

Other participants did not consider there to be set characteristics for such
oﬀenders, such as participant 3 who highlighted “I believe anybody is capable
of committing cybercrime, there are no ‘set’ characteristics associated”, and
participant 7, who considered that any such characteristics are likely to diminish
in the future: “the opportunity for all persons (current non cyber criminals)
to learn how to commit cyber crime is prevalent and available. The attraction
of anonymity surrounding access to the dark web and crypto currency makes
committing this type of criminality more appealing. Therefore opening the door
to creating an alternate cyber criminal proﬁle.” Participant 6 echoed this view:
“I think as cyber-crime becomes more widespread and knowledge improves on
a large scale then there is more chance of diﬀerent character types becoming
involved”.

Cyber oﬀender motivations

Respondents were also asked, based on their experience, whether they felt there
were particular motivations for oﬀenders involved in cybercriminal activities.
Table 4 shows the motivations that were referenced as sometimes, often or
always a motivation by at least 50% of respondents.

Respondents expanded on these motivations in their open-ended responses,

again highlighting the role of diﬀerent cybercrime types in inﬂuencing these
motivations, and the inherent relationship between potential characteristics and
motivations. For example, participant 15 stated “with DDoS attacks, it can
often be jointly motivated by money and knowing that they have the ability to
disrupt and cause damage. For pharma/phishing it’s mainly ﬁnancially moti-
I think money will always drive it, with status/recognition following
vated. . .
closely behind. For younger oﬀenders it seems that developing skills/reputation
is the driving force.” Similarly, participant 6 considered “it depends on the crime
type. There is a correlation between those with fantastic computer knowledge
being introverted and often on the autistic spectrum. Their motivations might
not necessarily be purely ﬁnancial and the money could almost be a by-product
of their success. Adam Mudd would be a good example, sold DDOS services
but his main motivation seemed to be enjoying the success of being really good
at something.”

The growth in so-called cybercrime as a service was also considered to re-
ﬂect current and future motivations, with participant 1 highlighting “cybercrime
is becoming more of a service with the main motive being ﬁnancial and bet-
ter organized across international OCG’s” and participant 6 stating “the wider
range of people who become involved could mean that wider motivations are
changing ”. Whilst some participants considered that the focus of cybercrime
is “becoming more ﬁnancially motivated”(participant 1), others considered that
such motivations may continue to change based on perceived outcomes, such as
participant 16 who suggested that “some motivations might be reinforced and
become more signiﬁcant. E.g. the more victims who pay ransomware demands
will obviously provide the oﬀender ﬁnancial reward and they are likely to con-
tinue or escalate (the same is true of any crime with ﬁnancial reward)”, as well
as wider motivations linked to hostile state actors “there may be a secondary
motivation to cause disruption on behalf of a nation state, rather than being
the sole ﬁnancial benefactor of the attack”(participant 2). Finally, the role of
online communities was also highlighted by participant 3, who stated “as online
communities grow (especially anonymous ones, Tor and other darkwebs) people

feel the need to impress these new communities”.

Conclusions

This work in progress explores the characteristics and motivations of oﬀenders
involved in cybercriminal activities. A number of characteristics and motivations
were identiﬁed based on previous literature and the convergence of these with
the current experiences of law enforcement practitioners was examined using a
targeted online survey. Overall, ﬁndings demonstrated support for three char-
acteristics already highlighted in prior research (younger age, being male, and
greater computer use) and multiple motivations, with ﬁnancial gain and a feel-
ing of power and status being the most common motivations. Several nuances
in characteristics and motivations were also considered by practitioners related
to the particular type of cybercrime engaged in, and how these various aspects
appear to be evolving due to the increasing availability of tools, the growth of
cyber-crime as a service, and the involvement of organized crime groups and
nation states in malevolent cyber activity.

Such ﬁndings are not only relevant to the academic research community,
but also those working as practitioners within the cyber security ﬁeld.
In par-
ticular, understanding how characteristics and motivations may be evolving in
the current threat environment, how they relate to diﬀerent cyber threats, and
the potential impact that this may have in relation to the optimal protection
of systems and data. For example, the perceived prevalence of ransomware,
the ﬁnancial motivations linked to this, and the potential growth of individuals
involved in such activity, including the involvement of organized crime groups
and nation states and the provision of cybercrime as a service. The continuing
professionalization of such activities, and the relative ease of access to technical
skills for criminal groups by ‘contracting out’ these aspects, is important to con-
sider when mitigating against these threats. The continued and wide-spread use
of so-called ‘low tech’ activities, such as phishing, is also important to consider,
particularly when tools to help people with little knowledge ‘enter’ this area are
readily available. Indeed, continued development of socio-technical mitigations
to phishing and similar threats should remain an active area of research (e.g.,
[42, 12]). The focus on ﬁnancial gain highlights the primary threats to orga-
nizations in this respect, and the potential for some oﬀenders who are initially
motivated by intellectual challenge, learning or status to be drawn in to orga-
nized crime or other ﬁnancially-motivated aspects due to their technical skill
continues to present an issue.

In this sense, these ﬁndings also provide useful information regarding the
continued development of interventions that aim to reduce cyber oﬀending and
redirect individuals to positive career paths (e.g., [1]). These ﬁndings highlight
the continued perspective that oﬀenders are from younger age groups, are pri-

marily male, and can be vulnerable to exploitation by organized crime groups
and others who aim to use their technical skill for ﬁnancially-motivated (and in-
deed other forms) of cyber criminal activities. The role of perceptions of power,
status and ego as key motivations for cyber oﬀenders are also relevant here,
since this may not only inﬂuence the likely activities (and potential targets) of
cyber oﬀenders, but also the requirement to further understand the communi-
ties, relationships and structures that encourage, or indeed discourage, these
activities.

Limitations and Next Steps

It should be acknowledged that this data is based upon the responses of a rel-
atively small number of practitioners working in cybercrime related roles within
law enforcement contexts in a particular geographic region. This presents a
research limitation, but access to such practitioners is a diﬃcult task and they
have provided a diverse range of views and experiences in the qualitative data
collected. It should also be acknowledged that responses were self-report. This
work focused on analyzing the views, perspectives and experiences of practition-
ers working in this ﬁeld and this approach was suitable to achieve this, but it is
possible that practitioner views are, to a degree, inﬂuenced by wider stereotypes,
media information and research ﬁndings. It is also likely that practitioner views
will be somewhat biased towards those cybercriminal activities (and the individ-
uals engaged in them) that they are aware of (i.e., those individuals who have
been caught or who are known to authorities). As such, these ﬁndings would
beneﬁt from further validation using additional data sources, which continuing
work is aiming to address this.
